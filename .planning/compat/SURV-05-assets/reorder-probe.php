/**
 * Effective top-level ORDER probe for SURV-05 (the top-level-reorder exception).
 *
 * Maestro's Replay applies top-level order through the `custom_menu_order` +
 * `menu_order` filters at render time, NOT in the admin_menu replay pass — so a
 * raw $menu dump does not reflect it. This probe reproduces the render-time order
 * resolution: it hooks admin_menu @ PHP_INT_MAX — the SAME priority Maestro's
 * `Replay::replay()` uses (`includes/class-replay.php:56`). At an identical
 * priority WordPress fires callbacks in registration order, and Maestro registers
 * its `admin_menu` hook in its constructor at plugin-load time (long before this
 * eval-file runs), so this probe's callback is appended AFTER Maestro's and
 * therefore runs AFTER Maestro's own replay. It then applies the SAME core
 * pipeline WP uses (custom_menu_order gate + menu_order filter over the top-level
 * slugs) and prints the resulting effective order. It exits before
 * wp-admin/menu.php's privilege filtering (which wp_die()s under WP-CLI).
 *
 * Usage (from tests/compat), with maestro_config set to the desired top_order:
 *   npx wp-env run cli -- php -d memory_limit=512M /usr/local/bin/wp \
 *     --exec="define('WP_ADMIN', true);" \
 *     eval-file wp-content/plugins/maestro-menu-editor/.planning/compat/SURV-05-assets/reorder-probe.php \
 *     --user=admin
