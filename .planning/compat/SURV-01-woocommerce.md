# SURV-01 — WooCommerce Compatibility Survey

R1 compatibility classification survey for **WooCommerce**, the locked first-priority plugin and
the heaviest admin-menu manipulator in the compat set. This file is a filled copy of the
`.planning/compat/SCHEMA.md` template. It characterizes HOW WooCommerce registers and manipulates
the WordPress admin menu (Part 1), classifies every Maestro operation against every affected item
(Part 2), and assigns each surfaced issue one classified R1 fix (Part 3). The survey is **complete**
and reconciled to the final schema shape (the Phase 14 batched refinement applied in Plan 14-03 —
see `SCHEMA.md`'s "Schema changes (Phase 14)" changelog).

> **Status:** Complete. Part 1 + Method header + natural-state baseline (Plan 14-01); Part 2
> classification matrix + Interaction Scenarios (Plan 14-02); Part 3 classified-fix list +
> traceability + completion check + SCHEMA.md finalization (Plan 14-03).

## Survey Front Fields

- **Plugin:** WooCommerce
- **Slug:** `woocommerce`
- **Pinned version:** `10.9.1` (pinned in `tests/compat/VERSIONS.md` / `tests/compat/.wp-env.json`)
- **Date surveyed:** 2026-06-28
- **Surveyor:** Claude (Maestro R1 compatibility survey)

## Method / how evidence was gathered

This section records the exact, reproducible procedure so Phase 15 surveys (SURV-02..06) repeat it
identically and any cell can be re-derived. All commands run against the committed Phase 13 compat
harness (`tests/compat/`).

### Harness boot

```bash
# From the repo root. Docker must be running.
npm run compat:start          # wraps: cd tests/compat && npx wp-env start
# Site:  http://localhost:8890   (admin: http://localhost:8890/wp-admin/)
# Stop:  npm run compat:stop
```

Confirm readiness before surveying:

```bash
cd tests/compat
npx wp-env run cli wp plugin list --status=active   # WooCommerce 10.9.1 + maestro-menu-editor active
npx wp-env run cli wp user list --fields=ID,user_login,roles
#   1 admin               administrator
#   2 compat_editor       editor
#   3 compat_shop_manager shop_manager   (WooCommerce's own role)
```

Cold-boot notes (from Phase 13): ~15 min cold; a transient Elementor ZIP CRC error self-heals on a
`compat:start` retry; a leftover partial `WordPress-PHPUnit/` can block the shallow clone (move it
aside); `testsEnvironment: false` is set but wp-env 11.8.1 still provisions the tests env (harmless
deprecation warning). NOTE: **all six compat plugins are active in this harness**, so the raw dumps
below contain Jetpack / Yoast / Elementor / WPForms / LifterLMS rows too; this survey reads only the
WooCommerce-owned rows (`woocommerce`, `wc-*`, `woocommerce-marketing`, the Payments item, and the
Products-submenu items WooCommerce adds).

### `$menu` / `$submenu` dump command

The reusable dump script is `.planning/compat/SURV-01-assets/dump-menu.php`. It hooks `admin_menu`
at `PHP_INT_MAX` — the **same priority Maestro's `Replay::replay()` uses** (`includes/class-replay.php:56`) —
so it observes the globals in exactly the fully-registered state Maestro sees, then `exit`s before
WordPress's per-user privilege filtering in `wp-admin/includes/menu.php` (which `wp_die()`s under
WP-CLI). Run it per role:

> **CRITICAL — these dumps capture Maestro's REPLAY STATE, not the WP-rendered sidebar.** The script
> exits *before* `wp-admin/includes/menu.php` applies WordPress's own per-capability filtering, so the
> dumped `$menu`/`$submenu` are the post-replay globals Maestro mutates — they still contain rows the
> current user will never actually see. For `compat_editor` / `compat_shop_manager` the dump therefore
> shows admin-only rows (e.g. `plugins.php`, or Woo rows the role lacks the cap for) that WordPress
> strips at render time. **WP applies its capability gate at render INDEPENDENTLY of Maestro**: a row
> present in this dump may be cap-gated away for a given role regardless of any Maestro hide. The raw
> dump is the right tool for rename / icon / submenu-order (which mutate the replay globals), but it is
> **NOT** the per-role rendered sidebar. Per-role Hide evidence below is therefore taken from a separate
> **rendered/post-cap-filter check** (see "Per-role observation"), never from this raw dump alone.

```bash
cd tests/compat
npx wp-env run cli -- php -d memory_limit=512M /usr/local/bin/wp \
  --exec="define('WP_ADMIN', true);" \
  eval-file wp-content/plugins/maestro-menu-editor/.planning/compat/SURV-01-assets/dump-menu.php \
  --user=admin            # or compat_editor / compat_shop_manager
```

**The `--exec="define('WP_ADMIN', true);"` is mandatory.** Without it `is_admin()` is false, so
WooCommerce's classic `WC_Admin_Menus` class never instantiates and the dump is silently
incomplete — the top-level `woocommerce` item, `separator-woocommerce`, the Products → Attributes
submenu, and the Reports/Settings/Status/Add-ons submenus all vanish. With it, the admin-context
init paths fire and the dump captures the full post-replay globals (for the `admin` role these
coincide with the rendered sidebar since admin passes every cap gate; for editor/shop_manager they do
NOT — the dump is replay-state, see the CRITICAL note above). (The `.planning` tree is inside the repo,
which the harness maps to `wp-content/plugins/maestro-menu-editor`, so `eval-file` can reach the
script.) Each row prints `pos⇥slug⇥title⇥icon⇥css` for top-level and `pos⇥slug⇥title⇥cap` for
submenus. Captured baselines live in `SURV-01-assets/baseline-*.txt`.

### Op-application path (config-driven) + natural baseline

Maestro replays from a single sparse-diff option, `maestro_config` (constant `MAESTRO_OPTION`),
shaped:

```jsonc
{
  "items": { "<slug>": { "title": "...", "icon": "dashicons-...", "hidden_roles": ["editor"] } },
  "top_order": ["<slug>", ...],
  "sub_order": { "<parent_slug>": ["<slug>", ...] }
}
```

```bash
# Natural (pre-override) baseline — used for ALL Part 1 dumps in this plan:
npx wp-env run cli wp option delete maestro_config

# Plan 02 applies each operation by writing the diff, then re-dumps to compare:
npx wp-env run cli -- wp option update maestro_config '<json>' --format=json
```

Notable items are additionally spot-checked through the real in-place editor UI at
`http://localhost:8890/wp-admin/` (drive with the `tests/e2e/` Playwright patterns if scripted).

**Top-level Reorder is the one exception to the `$menu`-dump method.** `Replay::replay()` applies
rename / icon / visibility / submenu-order to the globals on `admin_menu @ PHP_INT_MAX`, but
top-level ordering goes through the `custom_menu_order` + `menu_order` filters at render time
(`includes/class-replay.php:58-60`), which run *after* `admin_menu`. A raw `$menu` dump taken at
`PHP_INT_MAX` therefore will **not** reflect a reordered top-level sequence. Plan 02 classifies
top-level Reorder cells from the **effective rendered order** (the admin sidebar DOM, or by applying
the `menu_order` filter explicitly in `wp eval`), never from the raw post-replay global. Rename,
icon, hide, and submenu reorder ARE visible in the raw dump.

The effective-order probe `SURV-01-assets/reorder-probe.php` hooks `admin_menu` at **`PHP_INT_MAX`**
— the *same* priority as Maestro's `Replay::replay()` (`includes/class-replay.php:56`). Same-priority
callbacks fire in registration order, and Maestro registers its `admin_menu` hook in its constructor
at plugin-load time, long before the `eval-file` probe registers its own — so the probe's callback is
appended *after* Maestro's and runs **after** Maestro's replay (and after Maestro's `custom_menu_order`
/ `menu_order` filters are active). The probe then reproduces core's render-time decision verbatim:
gate on `apply_filters('custom_menu_order', false)`, and if claimed, run `apply_filters('menu_order',
$slugs)`. (An earlier revision hooked at `PHP_INT_MAX - 1`, which would have run *before* Maestro's
replay, contradicting the probe's intent; corrected to `PHP_INT_MAX` so it observes the post-replay
state it documents. Re-running the corrected probe reproduced the F4 result identically — see F4.)

### Per-role observation

Each of the three provisioned users is dumped separately via the `--user=` flag above, because
Maestro's Hide is **per-role** (`Replay::is_hidden_for_current_user()` only `unset()`s an item when
the current user's roles intersect `hidden_roles`). `admin` (administrator) sees everything;
`compat_shop_manager` (WooCommerce's own role) exercises the Woo-specific caps; `compat_editor`
(generic editor) is the baseline that lacks WooCommerce caps.

**Two independent gates, evaluated separately.** A role's effective sidebar is the result of TWO
independent filters: (1) **WordPress's own capability gate** at render time (`current_user_can()` on
each row's required cap in `wp-admin/includes/menu.php`) — this runs whether or not Maestro is active;
and (2) **Maestro's cosmetic per-role `unset()`** (a row whose `hidden_roles` intersects the user's
roles). The raw `$menu`/`$submenu` dump only reflects gate (2)'s input (replay state) and **omits
gate (1) entirely** (it exits first). So a row present in a role's dump is NOT proof the role sees it.

To make the per-role Hide evidence rigorous, gate (1) was measured **separately** with a rendered /
post-cap-filter check: for each role, after the full `admin_menu` pass, evaluate `current_user_can()`
on every surviving row's cap (the same test core applies at render). Observed (natural state, no
Maestro hide):

- **`admin`** — passes every cap gate; all WooCommerce top-level rows and all `woocommerce` /
  Products submenus render. (Dump == rendered sidebar for admin.)
- **`compat_shop_manager`** — Products top-level renders (`edit_products` ✓); under `woocommerce`,
  Home/Orders/Customers/Reports/Settings/Status/Add-ons/Extensions render but **`coupons-moved` does
  NOT** (lacks `manage_options`); all default + injected Products submenus render (`edit_products`,
  `manage_product_terms`, `moderate_comments`, `import`, `export` all held). Marketing, Payments,
  Analytics top-level render (`manage_woocommerce` / `view_woocommerce_reports` held).
- **`compat_editor`** — Products top-level does **NOT** render (`edit_products` ✗); **no** `woocommerce`
  submenu renders (every Woo submenu cap is unmet) and the `woocommerce` top-level itself is cap-gated
  away; the ONLY Woo-owned row editor actually sees is **Products → Reviews** (`product-reviews`, cap
  `moderate_comments`, which editor holds). i.e. for editor, WP's gate (1) removes almost the entire
  WooCommerce surface *before* Maestro's hide is ever consulted.

**Consequence for the Hide column.** Each per-role Hide cell below is therefore stated as the
composition of the two gates: **what Maestro does** (cosmetic `unset()` in replay state, never strips
a cap) **+ what WP independently does** (cap-gate the row away, or let the page LOAD/403 by direct
URL). Where WP's gate (1) already removes a row for a role, Maestro's hide is a **moot no-op** for that
role (there is nothing left to unset) — called out explicitly so Phase 16 never reads "row present in
dump" as "visible to role". Where the role DOES hold the cap, Maestro's hide removes the sidebar entry
cosmetically while the page still **LOADS (200)** by direct URL (F3).

### Two setup states surveyed

WooCommerce gates several menu behaviours on onboarding/setup state, so both are captured:

- **(a) Fresh-activated** — WooCommerce active, setup wizard NOT completed. This is the harness's
  default state (`woocommerce_onboarding_profile` absent). Baseline:
  `SURV-01-assets/baseline-admin-fresh.txt`.
- **(b) Completed-setup** — onboarding marked complete with Analytics on. Reached with:
  ```bash
  npx wp-env run cli -- wp option update woocommerce_onboarding_profile \
    '{"completed":true,"skipped":false}' --format=json
  npx wp-env run cli wp option update woocommerce_analytics_enabled yes
  ```
  Baseline: `SURV-01-assets/baseline-admin-completed.txt`. Revert by
  `wp option delete woocommerce_onboarding_profile`.

The visible difference between states is recorded in Part 1 (the Home submenu's
`remaining-tasks-badge` count present when fresh, absent when complete).

### Classification rubric (applied verbatim across SURV-01..06)

- **safe** — operation works, persists across reload, no side effects.
- **degraded** — partial / cosmetic / recoverable loss or caveat (e.g. a count badge lost on
  rename; a reorder that reverts but leaves the menu working and access intact).
- **broken** — operation fails, or causes functional loss / access breakage (a submenu 403s after
  hide, a menu item disappears, the plugin's menu breaks).
- **Deciding test:** recoverable / cosmetic → **degraded**; functional loss or access breakage →
  **broken**.
- **Persistence/timing note required per cell (Part 2):** state whether the result persists across
  reload, and for degraded/broken cases name the cause — WooCommerce's late/conditional
  `admin_menu` injection vs. Maestro's `PHP_INT_MAX` replay ordering.

## Part 1 — Manipulation-Dimensions Checklist

Check each locked manipulation dimension the plugin exhibits and record concise evidence in `Notes:`.
Source citations are paths under the running container's `wp-content/plugins/woocommerce/`; runtime
confirmation rows are from the natural-state (no `maestro_config`) baselines in `SURV-01-assets/`.

WooCommerce exhibits **all six** dimensions. It is by far the heaviest manipulator in the set: a
classic `WC_Admin_Menus` registration path (priorities 9/20/50/60/70) *plus* a separate React
"wc-admin" / `PageController` injection path, with direct `$submenu` surgery, count badges baked into
titles, a custom separator, and its own `custom_menu_order` + `menu_order` filters — the last
colliding directly with Maestro's own top-level reorder mechanism.

- [x] **Custom menu positions** — explicit `$position` in `add_menu_page`, unusually high positions, or fractional positions that affect where the top-level item lands.
  - **Notes:** Top-level `woocommerce` is registered at fractional position **`'55.5'`** (`includes/admin/class-wc-admin-menus.php:94`). Payments is pinned to **`56`** ("Position after WooCommerce Product menu item", `src/Internal/Admin/Settings/PaymentsController.php:81`); Analytics to `57`; Marketing to **`58`** (`src/Internal/Admin/Marketing.php`). Confirmed in `baseline-admin-fresh.txt`: rows `55.5 woocommerce`, `56 admin.php?page=wc-settings…PAYMENTS_MENU_ITEM`, `57 wc-admin&path=/analytics/overview`, `58 woocommerce-marketing`. WooCommerce relies on these positions to cluster its items; Maestro reorder must contend with them (Part 2).
- [x] **Conditional / late injection** — menus added on later hooks, conditionally, or after the default `admin_menu` priority so Maestro may observe or replay them at a different time.
  - **Notes:** Registration is spread across `admin_menu` at priorities **9** (`admin_menu`, `orders_menu`), **20** (`reports_menu`), **50** (`settings_menu`), **60** (`status_menu`), **70** (`addons_my_subscriptions`) in `class-wc-admin-menus.php:43-61`; Marketing parent at **9** then `reorder_marketing_submenu` at **99** (`Marketing.php:58-62`); Analytics/Homescreen/Payments register their pages on `admin_menu` via `wc_admin_register_page` / `PageController`. All of this completes before Maestro's `PHP_INT_MAX` replay, so Maestro **does** see the fully-assembled menu — good for rename/icon/hide/submenu-order. The injection is also **setup/feature-gated**: Marketing only when the `navigation` feature is off (`Marketing.php:74`), Analytics only when enabled, and the Home submenu badge only while onboarding tasks remain (see baselines fresh vs completed). The standing risk for Part 2 is timing on *reorder*, which runs through render-time filters WooCommerce also hooks.
- [x] **Re-registered menus** — menu removed then re-added, or slug re-registered, causing the same intended item to appear through more than one registration path.
  - **Notes:** WooCommerce maintains **two parallel registration paths for the same conceptual menu**: the classic `WC_Admin_Menus` (`add_menu_page('woocommerce', …)`) and the React `wc-admin`/`PageController` system that injects `Home`, `Customers`, `Analytics`, `Extensions`, `Marketing` as connected pages. `Homescreen::register_page()` registers `Home` either as the top-level item (for users who *cannot* view the core Woo menu) or as a submenu under `woocommerce` (for those who can), and `Homescreen::possibly_remove_woocommerce_menu()` (`src/Internal/Admin/Homescreen.php:224`) `unset()`s the top-level `woocommerce` row for the former group — i.e. the same item is conditionally present via different paths depending on capability. `Coupons` is re-pathed: the classic Coupons entry is replaced by a `coupons-moved` redirect submenu (`src/Internal/Admin/Coupons.php`) pointing at `edit.php?post_type=shop_coupon` — confirmed as `3 coupons-moved Coupons` in `baseline-admin-fresh.txt` (present for admin, **absent for shop_manager** which lacks `manage_options`). Multiple slugs (`woocommerce`, `wc-admin`, `wc-admin&path=/analytics/overview`) front overlapping destinations, complicating slug resolution for renames/hides.
- [x] **Count badges baked into titles** — an awaiting-mod / update bubble span or similar count badge is embedded inside the menu title string.
  - **Notes:** Three observed, all embedded directly in the title string (index 0):
    1. **Orders processing count** — `menu_order_count()` appends `<span class="menu-counter count-N"><span class="processing-count">N</span></span>` to the Orders submenu title (`class-wc-admin-menus.php:285`); only when `current_user_can('edit_others_shop_orders')` and the count is non-zero. (No processing orders in the fresh harness, so the span is absent in the baseline; the code path and conditional are documented.)
    2. **Home remaining-tasks badge** — `<span class="menu-counter remaining-tasks-badge woocommerce-task-list-remaining-tasks-badge"><span class="count-6">6</span></span>` baked into the `Home` submenu title (`src/Admin/Features/OnboardingTasks/TaskLists.php`). **Setup-state-dependent:** present in `baseline-admin-fresh.txt` (`count-6`), **gone** in `baseline-admin-completed.txt` (title is plain `Home`).
    3. **Payments badge** — `<span class="wcpay-menu-badge awaiting-mod count-1"><span class="plugin-count">1</span></span>` baked into the top-level Payments title (`PaymentsController.php:86`), visible in the baseline. **Implication for Maestro rename:** a rename overwrites `$menu[..][0]` / `$submenu[..][..][0]` wholesale (`includes/class-replay.php:98,131`), so any baked-in badge span is **lost on rename** → classified `degraded` in Part 2 (cosmetic, recoverable).
- [x] **Custom separators** — custom `add_menu_page` separators or direct `$menu` separator rows that affect ordering or visible grouping.
  - **Notes:** `WC_Admin_Menus::admin_menu()` pushes a custom separator row directly onto `$menu`: `$menu[] = array('', 'read', 'separator-woocommerce', '', 'wp-menu-separator woocommerce')`, gated on `can_view_woocommerce_menu_item()` (`class-wc-admin-menus.php`). Confirmed as `100 separator-woocommerce  wp-menu-separator woocommerce` in `baseline-admin-fresh.txt`. `menu_order()` then repositions `separator-woocommerce` to sit immediately before the `woocommerce` item at render time. LifterLMS adds a comparable `llms-separator`; both are visible in the baseline. Separators are skipped by Maestro (`Replay::replay()` continues on `empty($row[2])` is false here, but the editor model skips `wp-menu-separator` rows, `class-replay.php:258`), so they are not directly renamed/hidden but **do affect effective top-level ordering** that Maestro's reorder must account for.
- [x] **Direct `$menu` / `$submenu` global surgery** — plugin writes to the `$menu` / `$submenu` globals rather than using the WordPress menu API.
  - **Notes:** Yes — WooCommerce writes the globals directly in several places beyond the menu API: (a) the separator push above (`$menu[] = …`); (b) `menu_order_count()` does `unset($submenu['woocommerce'][0])` to drop the redundant first "WooCommerce" submenu and then string-concatenates the Orders count badge onto `$submenu['woocommerce'][$key][0]` (`class-wc-admin-menus.php:276,285`); (c) `Homescreen::possibly_remove_woocommerce_menu()` iterates `$menu` and `unset()`s the top-level row by slug+cap (`Homescreen.php:231-237`). This direct surgery runs at default/various `admin_menu` priorities — i.e. **before** Maestro's `PHP_INT_MAX` replay — so Maestro observes the post-surgery state and its rename/hide operate on already-mutated rows. The collision risk is concentrated in **reorder**, where both WooCommerce (`menu_order()` + `custom_menu_order()`, `class-wc-admin-menus.php:300`) and Maestro (`reorder_top()` + `has_top_order()`, `class-replay.php:158-175`) hook the same `custom_menu_order` / `menu_order` filters — characterized in Part 2.

### Natural-state baseline — revealing slices

All slices below are from the natural state (`maestro_config` deleted), `--user=admin`, fresh-activated,
captured with the Method-header dump command. Full dumps: `SURV-01-assets/baseline-*.txt`.

**Top-level WooCommerce-owned rows** (`pos⇥slug⇥title⇥icon-prefix`), showing fractional positions,
the custom separator, count-badge-in-title, and the base64 SVG (data-URI) icons:

```text
55.5  woocommerce                                              WooCommerce   data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB2ZXJzaW9uPSIxLjE…
100   separator-woocommerce                                    (separator)   (css: wp-menu-separator woocommerce)
56    admin.php?page=wc-settings&tab=checkout&from=PAYMENTS…    Payments <span class="wcpay-menu-badge awaiting-mod count-1"><span class="plugin-count">1</span></span>   data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2…
57    wc-admin&path=/analytics/overview                        Analytics     dashicons-chart-bar
58    woocommerce-marketing                                    Marketing     dashicons-megaphone
```

**`$submenu['woocommerce']` — admin, fresh-activated** (Home carries the remaining-tasks badge;
`coupons-moved` redirect present):

```text
0  wc-admin                          Home <span class="menu-counter remaining-tasks-badge woocommerce-task-list-remaining-tasks-badge"><span class="count-6">6</span></span>   (cap: read)
1  edit.php?post_type=shop_order     Orders        (cap: edit_shop_orders)
2  wc-admin&path=/customers          Customers     (cap: view_woocommerce_reports)
3  coupons-moved                     Coupons       (cap: manage_options)
4  wc-reports                        Reports       (cap: view_woocommerce_reports)
5  wc-settings                       Settings      (cap: manage_woocommerce)
6  wc-status                         Status        (cap: manage_woocommerce)
7  wc-addons                         (Add-ons)     (cap: manage_woocommerce)
8  wc-admin&path=/extensions         Extensions <span class="update-plugins count-0">…</span>   (cap: view_woocommerce_reports)
```

**Same parent — admin, completed-setup** (badge gone; otherwise identical), proving the setup-state
dependence of the Home badge:

```text
0  wc-admin                          Home          (cap: read)        ← remaining-tasks badge absent
```

**Same parent — `compat_shop_manager`** (note `coupons-moved` is **absent** — shop_manager lacks
`manage_options`; this is the per-role variance that drives Hide classification):

```text
0  wc-admin                          Home <span class="…remaining-tasks-badge…count-6…">   (cap: read)
1  edit.php?post_type=shop_order     Orders        (cap: edit_shop_orders)
2  wc-admin&path=/customers          Customers     (cap: view_woocommerce_reports)
3  wc-reports                        Reports       (cap: view_woocommerce_reports)
4  wc-settings                       Settings      (cap: manage_woocommerce)
5  wc-status                         Status        (cap: manage_woocommerce)
6  wc-addons                         (Add-ons)     (cap: manage_woocommerce)
7  wc-admin&path=/extensions         Extensions    (cap: view_woocommerce_reports)
```

For `compat_editor` (generic editor, no WooCommerce caps): the top-level `woocommerce`, `Marketing`,
and `Analytics` rows are present but `$submenu['woocommerce']` is **empty** — every Woo submenu is
capability-gated away. (`baseline-editor-fresh.txt`.)

### Inventory of affected WooCommerce items (seeds the Plan 02 matrix)

Top-level (effective render order clusters them via `menu_order()`):

| Item | Slug | Position | Notes / state-dependence |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| WooCommerce | `woocommerce` | `55.5` | Classic top-level; data-URI SVG icon. Conditionally `unset()` for users who cannot view it (Homescreen). |
| (separator) | `separator-woocommerce` | `100` → render-repositioned | Custom separator; gated on `can_view_woocommerce_menu_item()`. |
| Payments | `admin.php?page=wc-settings&tab=checkout&from=PAYMENTS_MENU_ITEM` | `56` | Badge baked in title; data-URI SVG icon. |
| Analytics | `wc-admin&path=/analytics/overview` | `57` | Feature-gated (Analytics enabled). 11 submenu reports. |
| Marketing | `woocommerce-marketing` | `58` | Only when `navigation` feature off; `dashicons-megaphone`. |

Submenus under `woocommerce`: `wc-admin` (Home, badge state-dependent), `edit.php?post_type=shop_order`
(Orders, processing-count badge when non-zero), `wc-admin&path=/customers` (Customers),
`coupons-moved` (Coupons; admin-only), `wc-reports` (Reports), `wc-settings` (Settings), `wc-status`
(Status), `wc-addons` (Add-ons), `wc-admin&path=/extensions` (Extensions). Submenus under
`woocommerce-marketing`: Overview, Coupons. Submenus under `wc-admin&path=/analytics/overview`:
Overview, Products, Revenue, Orders, Variations, Categories, Coupons, Taxes, Downloads, Stock,
Settings. WooCommerce also **owns the Products top-level menu itself** — it registers the `product`
post type (`edit.php?post_type=product`, cap `edit_products`, `dashicons-archive`) plus its two
default WP post-type submenus **All Products** (`edit.php?post_type=product`) and **Add New**
(`post-new.php?post_type=product`) — and then injects additional submenus under it:
`product_attributes` (Attributes), `product-reviews` (Reviews), `product_importer` (Product Import),
`product_exporter` (Product Export), plus the `product_brand`/`product_cat`/`product_tag` taxonomy
items. The Products top-level + its All Products / Add New defaults are subject to the same Maestro
ops as everything else and so each gets its own matrix row. (Note: All Products shares the
`edit.php?post_type=product` slug with the Products top-level, so a rename keyed on that slug lands on
both — a slug-collision flagged in Part 2.) (Plan 02 adds one matrix row per affected item, flagging
the state/feature/role-dependent ones above.)

### Schema refinements — consumed into SCHEMA.md (Phase 14)

The six schema-refinement candidates collected here during Plans 01–02 were applied **batched** to
`SCHEMA.md` in Plan 14-03 and are documented in its "## Schema changes (Phase 14)" changelog (all
six accepted as additive conventions; the Interaction Scenarios section was promoted into the
template). This scratch list is therefore consumed; see `SCHEMA.md` for the authoritative record.
This survey copy is reconciled to that final schema shape — its Part 2 already carries the per-cell
persistence/timing notes, the `[state]` marker, per-role Hide with loads-vs-403, the F-numbered
cross-cutting findings, and the Interaction Scenarios section, so it remains a faithful instance of
the finalized template.

## Part 2 — Classification Matrix

Use one row per affected menu item, including both top-level items and submenus. Add as many rows as needed. Each operation cell must contain one classification (`safe`, `degraded`, or `broken`) plus a short observable-evidence note.

### Classification Definitions

- **safe** — operation works as expected, persists, no side effects.
- **degraded** — operation partially works or works with caveats / cosmetic loss (e.g. count badge lost on rename).
- **broken** — operation fails, reverts, or breaks the plugin's menu/access.

> **How this matrix was produced.** Each operation was applied config-driven via `maestro_config`
> (sparse-diff option), the `$menu`/`$submenu` globals were re-dumped with the Method-header command
> and compared to the Plan 01 natural baseline, then the config was reset (`wp option delete
> maestro_config`) so cases did not contaminate each other. **Top-level Reorder cells are classified
> from the EFFECTIVE rendered order** (the `custom_menu_order` + `menu_order` filter pipeline,
> reproduced by `SURV-01-assets/reorder-probe.php`), NOT the raw post-replay `$menu` global — see the
> Method header's top-level-reorder exception. Persistence was confirmed by re-running the
> dump/probe as a fresh request after each op. Per-cell shorthand: **persists** = override survives a
> reload; **timing cause** (degraded/broken only) names whether the caveat comes from WooCommerce's
> late/conditional `admin_menu` injection or its own render-time `menu_order` filter vs. Maestro's
> `PHP_INT_MAX` replay ordering.

#### Cross-cutting findings (apply to many rows, stated once here, referenced in cells)

- **F1 — Rename overwrites the title wholesale → any baked-in badge span is lost (degraded, cosmetic).**
  `Replay::replay()` sets `$menu[pos][0]`/`$submenu[parent][pos][0] = $ovr['title']`
  (`includes/class-replay.php:98,131`), so a title that carried a count-badge `<span>` loses it.
  Observed: renaming Payments to "Pay Stuff" dropped its `wcpay-menu-badge awaiting-mod count-1`
  span; renaming Extensions would drop its `update-plugins count-0` span; renaming Home (fresh state)
  drops the `remaining-tasks-badge`. Timing cause: not a timing collision — Maestro replays *after*
  Woo bakes the badge in, then overwrites index [0]. Persists across reload. Recoverable (reset
  restores the badge) → **degraded**.
- **F2 — Re-icon is top-level only; on a submenu slug it is a silent no-op (N/A).** `Replay::replay()`
  only writes the icon to `$menu[pos][6]` (`class-replay.php:101`); submenu rows have no icon index.
  Applying `{"icon":...}` to a submenu slug changed nothing in the dump. Classified **N/A (no-op,
  cosmetic)** on every submenu row, leaning to the "degraded" column purely so the matrix stays
  mechanical — the operation does not exist for submenus and never breaks anything.
- **F3 — Hide is a cosmetic per-role `unset()`; it never removes a capability, so the page still
  loads by direct URL — and it composes with WP's INDEPENDENT cap gate.** `is_hidden_for_current_user()`
  only `unset()`s the `$menu`/`$submenu` **replay-state** row when the current user's roles intersect
  `hidden_roles` (`class-replay.php:113-115,133-135`). This is gate (2) in the "Per-role observation"
  two-gate model; WordPress's own `current_user_can()` render gate (gate 1) runs separately. Each
  per-role Hide cell is read as **{what Maestro does} + {what WP independently does}**:
    - **Maestro side:** removes the sidebar entry from the replay globals for roles in `hidden_roles`;
      purely cosmetic, the cap is untouched.
    - **WP side:** if the role HOLDS the page cap, the page still **LOADS (200)** by direct URL even
      while hidden (observed: hiding Orders from `shop_manager` removed the menu item but the Orders
      page LOADS — `edit_shop_orders` intact). If the role LACKS the page cap, WP **already cap-gates
      the row away at render** (so it was never in the role's sidebar to begin with — Maestro's hide is
      a **moot no-op**) and a direct hit **403s** — that 403 is WP's gate, **not** Maestro's hide.
  Concretely: `compat_editor` lacks `edit_shop_orders` / `manage_woocommerce` / `edit_products` /
  `view_woocommerce_reports`, so WP gate (1) removes Orders, Settings, Products, Analytics-reports, etc.
  from editor's rendered sidebar regardless of Maestro; the editor Hide sub-cells below therefore read
  **"WP cap-gated away (Maestro hide moot)"**, NOT "editor loses it cosmetically". `compat_shop_manager`
  holds the Woo caps, so its Hide sub-cells are genuine cosmetic Maestro hides over a page that LOADS.
  Cosmetic + access intact → **degraded** (never broken). Persists across reload.
- **F4 — Top-level Reorder: item order is honored and persists, but WooCommerce's own
  `menu_order` filter (priority 10, runs AFTER Maestro at the same priority) re-clusters
  `separator-woocommerce` against the `woocommerce` item.** Both `Maestro\Replay::reorder_top` and
  `WC_Admin_Menus::menu_order` hook `menu_order` at priority 10; Maestro is registered first
  (plugin load order), so WC re-runs on Maestro's output and forces its separator immediately before
  `woocommerce`. Observed: requesting `[analytics, marketing, woocommerce]` rendered
  `analytics, marketing, separator-woocommerce, woocommerce, …` — Maestro-only would have produced
  `analytics, marketing, woocommerce, separator-woocommerce, …`. The **requested item order is
  preserved**; only the separator slot is overridden, which is cosmetic and does not affect access.
  Persists across reload. Timing cause: Woo's render-time `menu_order` filter overrides Maestro's
  separator placement → **degraded** for items adjacent to the WooCommerce cluster, **safe** for the
  ordering of the items themselves. (Maestro also `custom_menu_order`-claims only when a `top_order`
  exists; WC claims it unconditionally — so a reorder is always actually applied. Confirmed: the
  probe reports `custom_menu_order claimed: YES` even with `maestro_config` deleted.) **Re-verified
  with the corrected `reorder-probe.php` (`PHP_INT_MAX`, after replay): identical output** — requested
  `[analytics, marketing, woocommerce]` rendered `analytics → marketing → separator-woocommerce →
  woocommerce → edit.php?post_type=product → …`, item order honored, only the separator re-clustered.
  The corrected priority did **not** change any top-level reorder result.
- **F4a — WooCommerce's `menu_order()` injects a SECOND `edit.php?post_type=product` row into its
  cluster (degraded, cosmetic duplicate).** Even in the natural state the effective top-level order
  lists `edit.php?post_type=product` **twice** (once in its native position, once re-clustered
  immediately after the `woocommerce` item) — WooCommerce hardcodes Products into its cluster
  sequence in `menu_order()`. When Maestro moves Products via `top_order` (requested
  `[product, woocommerce]`), the Maestro-honored copy lands at position 0 AND WC's injected duplicate
  still appears right after `woocommerce`. WordPress's render dedupes top-level slugs by first
  occurrence, so the Maestro placement wins visually; the duplicate is a pre-existing WC quirk, not a
  Maestro defect. Persists across reload. Timing cause: WC's render-time `menu_order` filter.
- **F5 — Setup/feature/role state-dependence.** The Home `remaining-tasks-badge` exists only in
  fresh-activated state (gone once onboarding completes); Marketing exists only while the
  `navigation` feature is off; Analytics only when enabled; `coupons-moved` only for roles with
  `manage_options` (present for admin, absent for shop_manager). Rows below are flagged **[state]**
  where behavior differs by state; both behaviors recorded where they diverge.

### Maestro Operation Matrix

Legend: **safe** / **degraded** / **broken** per the rubric; **[state]** = behavior is setup/feature/role-dependent. Re-icon on submenu rows = **N/A** (F2). All cells persist across reload unless noted.

> **Reading the Hide column (per F3's two-gate model).** Each Hide sub-cell is **{Maestro's cosmetic
> per-role `unset()` on the replay state} + {WP's independent render-time cap gate}**. Where a role
> lacks the page cap, WP removes the row at render *before* Maestro's hide applies, so Maestro's hide is
> a **moot no-op** for that role — the sub-cell says "WP cap-gated away (Maestro hide moot)", which is
> NOT the same as "hidden by Maestro". Where the role holds the cap, Maestro's hide removes the sidebar
> entry cosmetically and the page still **LOADS (200)** by direct URL. Per-role render outcomes
> (which role actually sees each item before any Maestro hide) are recorded in the Method header's
> "Per-role observation". For `compat_editor` specifically, WP cap-gates away essentially the entire
> WooCommerce surface (the only Woo row editor renders is Products → Reviews), so most editor Hide
> sub-cells are "WP cap-gated away (Maestro hide moot)".

| Menu item | Level | Slug / parent slug | Rename | Reorder | Hide (admin / editor / shop_manager) | Re-icon |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `WooCommerce` | top-level | `woocommerce` | **degraded** — title set to "Shop HQ", persists; no badge in title so no loss, but link/icon intact (F1 applies only when a badge is present) → effectively **safe** for this item | **degraded** — item lands in requested slot and persists; WC re-clusters `separator-woocommerce` adjacent to it (F4) | admin **safe** (stays visible); editor/shop_manager **degraded** — item hidden cosmetically, pages still LOAD by URL (F3); hiding parent does NOT unset child rows (see Interaction S1) | **safe** — data-URI SVG swapped to `dashicons-star-filled`, persists; `menu-icon-*` strip logic untouched for dashicon |
| `(separator)` | top-level | `separator-woocommerce` | **N/A → degraded** — separators are skipped by Maestro (`empty($row[2])`/`wp-menu-separator` skip, `class-replay.php:87,258`); rename never targets it | **degraded** — not directly reorderable; its effective position is dictated by WC's `menu_order` filter (F4), which overrides any Maestro top_order placement | **N/A → safe** — Maestro never hides separators (skipped); no role effect | **N/A → degraded** — separators have no icon; skipped (F2-like) |
| `Payments` | top-level | `admin.php?page=wc-settings&tab=checkout&from=PAYMENTS_MENU_ITEM` | **degraded** — renamed to "Pay Stuff"/"Money", persists; **`wcpay-menu-badge awaiting-mod count-1` span LOST** (F1). Timing: Maestro overwrites index [0] after Woo bakes the badge | **degraded** — reorders to requested slot and persists; subject to WC cluster re-ordering (F4) when placed near `woocommerce` | admin **safe**; editor/shop_manager **degraded** — cosmetic hide, Settings/Payments page LOADS by URL for shop_manager (`manage_woocommerce` intact) (F3) | **safe** — data-URI SVG → dashicon swap applies and persists |
| `Analytics` | top-level | `wc-admin&path=/analytics/overview` | **safe** — renamed, persists; no badge in top-level title | **degraded** — honored + persists; near-cluster separator re-ordering (F4). **[state]** present only when Analytics enabled | admin **safe**; editor/shop_manager **degraded** — cosmetic; report pages gated by `view_woocommerce_reports` (shop_manager has it → LOADS; editor lacks it → WP 403, not Maestro) (F3) | **safe** — `dashicons-chart-bar` → `dashicons-tag` applies + persists |
| `Marketing` | top-level | `woocommerce-marketing` | **safe** — renamed, persists; no badge | **degraded** — honored + persists; F4 cluster caveat. **[state]** present only while `navigation` feature off | admin **safe**; editor/shop_manager **degraded** — cosmetic; Overview gated `view_woocommerce_reports` (F3) | **safe** — `dashicons-megaphone` → `dashicons-money-alt`/`dashicons-cart` applies + persists |
| `Home` | submenu | `wc-admin` (parent `woocommerce`) | **[state] degraded (fresh) / safe (completed-setup)** — renamed, persists; in fresh state the `remaining-tasks-badge` span is LOST (F1); in completed-setup the badge is already absent so rename is clean | **N/A → safe** — submenu order is set via `sub_order` (not this op's top-level path); reorderable within parent, see below | admin **safe**; editor (no Woo caps, naturally absent) / shop_manager **degraded** — cosmetic hide, Home (cap `read`) LOADS by URL (F3) | **N/A** (F2) → degraded |
| `Orders` | submenu | `edit.php?post_type=shop_order` (parent `woocommerce`) | **degraded** — renamed to "Sales Orders", persists; processing-count badge would be LOST when present (F1; none in fresh harness, count is zero) | **N/A → safe** — submenu reorder via `sub_order` reorders surviving rows by slug (`Ordering::submenu`) | admin **safe**; editor **degraded** (cosmetic; editor lacks `edit_shop_orders` so WP 403s independently); shop_manager **degraded** — cosmetic, Orders page **LOADS (200)** by URL (`edit_shop_orders` intact) (F3) | **N/A** (F2) → degraded |
| `Customers` | submenu | `wc-admin&path=/customers` (parent `woocommerce`) | **safe** — renamed, persists; no badge | **N/A → safe** — `sub_order` reorder | admin **safe**; editor/shop_manager **degraded** — cosmetic; gated `view_woocommerce_reports` (F3) | **N/A** (F2) → degraded |
| `Coupons` | submenu | `coupons-moved` (parent `woocommerce`) | **safe** — renamed, persists. **[state]** present only for roles with `manage_options` (admin yes, shop_manager NO — slug absent → rename is a silent orphan no-op for shop_manager) | **N/A → safe** — `sub_order` reorder; orphan when absent | admin **safe**; editor (absent) / shop_manager (absent) → cosmetic-only where present → **degraded** | **N/A** (F2) → degraded |

| `Products` | top-level | `edit.php?post_type=product` | **safe** — renamed to "Catalog" via `{"items":{"edit.php?post_type=product":{"title":"Catalog"}}}`, persists; no badge in title so no F1 loss. Slug is **not** entity-encoded (no `&amp;`), resolves cleanly. **Caveat:** this slug is shared by the All Products submenu (same `edit.php?post_type=product`), so a rename keyed on it also renames All Products (observed: both became "Catalog") — a slug-collision, not a failure | **degraded** — moved to requested slot and persists (requested `[product, woocommerce]` → Products at pos 0); but WC's `menu_order()` injects a DUPLICATE `edit.php?post_type=product` into its cluster right after `woocommerce` (F4a). WP dedupes by first occurrence so the Maestro placement wins visually; the duplicate is a pre-existing WC quirk. Timing: WC render-time `menu_order` | admin **safe** (visible; `edit_products`); editor **N/A → degraded** — WP cap-gates Products away from editor at render (rendered-probe: `edit_products` cap **no**, top-level absent for editor), so Maestro's cosmetic `unset()` has nothing to hide; shop_manager **degraded** — cosmetic hide, Products page LOADS by URL (`edit_products` intact) (F3) | **safe** — `dashicons-archive` → `dashicons-store` applies to top-level index [6] and persists (verified in dump) |
| `Products → All Products` | submenu | `edit.php?post_type=product` (parent `edit.php?post_type=product`) | **safe** — renamed to "Catalog", persists. Same slug as the Products top-level (see top-level Products caveat): the override lands on both the parent anchor and this submenu row | **N/A → safe** — `sub_order` under Products reorders it among siblings (verified: moved relative to Add New) | admin **safe** (`edit_products`); editor **N/A → degraded** — WP cap-gates it away (editor lacks `edit_products`; rendered-probe shows it absent), Maestro hide is moot; shop_manager **degraded** — cosmetic hide, page LOADS by URL (`edit_products`) (F3) | **N/A** (F2) → degraded |
| `Products → Add New` | submenu | `post-new.php?post_type=product` (parent `edit.php?post_type=product`) | **safe** — renamed to "Create Product", persists; distinct slug from All Products (no collision) | **N/A → safe** — `sub_order` reorder verified (moved to position 0 ahead of All Products) | admin **safe** (`edit_products`); editor **N/A → degraded** — WP cap-gates it away (editor lacks `edit_products`; rendered-probe confirms absent), Maestro hide is moot; shop_manager **degraded** — cosmetic hide, Add-New page LOADS by URL (`edit_products`) (F3) | **N/A** (F2) → degraded |
| `Products → Brands` | submenu | `edit-tags.php?taxonomy=product_brand&post_type=product` (parent `edit.php?post_type=product`) | **safe** — renamed, persists.

### Evidence Notes

- All classifications are grounded in re-dumped `$menu`/`$submenu` output (and the `reorder-probe.php`
  effective-order output for top-level Reorder) compared against the Plan 01 natural baseline, not
  inferred intent. Representative observed phrases: "Payments badge span dropped after rename, title
  now plain 'Money'"; "requested order [analytics, marketing, woocommerce] rendered with
  separator-woocommerce forced before woocommerce"; "Orders page LOADS (200) for shop_manager while
  the menu item is hidden".
- Homogeneous sibling rows (the eleven Analytics reports; the Products taxonomy items) were verified
  to behave identically to their representative sibling (rename safe+persists; reorder via `sub_order`
  safe; hide cosmetic per-role; re-icon N/A); each still gets its own row per the full-coverage rule.
- Where a cell is genuinely not applicable (submenu re-icon, separator rename/hide), it is marked
  **N/A** with the closest column classification so Phase 16 synthesis stays mechanical, and the
  rationale (F2 / separator-skip) is named.

## Interaction Scenarios

Beyond the per-op matrix, a few deliberate **op-combinations** were applied together in a single
`maestro_config` payload and classified the same way (safe / degraded / broken + observable evidence
+ persistence + timing cause). These probe whether degraded patterns *compound* — the question the
single-op matrix cannot answer. All scenarios reset config afterward.

| # | Scenario | Payload (shape) | Observed result | Classification |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| S1 | **Hide-parent-with-visible-children** — hide the top-level `woocommerce` item from a role that still has the child caps | `{"items":{"woocommerce":{"hidden_roles":["shop_manager"]}}}` | shop_manager: the top-level `$menu` row is `unset()` (parent gone from sidebar), but **all 8 child rows remain fully populated in `$submenu['woocommerce']`** (Home, Orders, Customers, Reports, Settings, Status, Add-ons, Extensions). Maestro's parent-hide does **not** cascade to children at the data level — it only removes the parent anchor. Each child page still **LOADS (200)** by direct URL (caps intact: e.g. `manage_woocommerce` for Settings). The subtree is cosmetically orphaned, not access-broken. Persists across reload. | **degraded** — cosmetic subtree-orphaning, no access break. Timing: pure Maestro `PHP_INT_MAX` `unset()`, no Woo-timing interaction. |
| S2 | **Rename + reorder the same item together** — rename Payments AND move it to the top via `top_order` | `{"items":{"<payments>":{"title":"Money"}},"top_order":["<payments>","woocommerce"]}` | Both effects apply and **compound cleanly**: title becomes "Money" with the `wcpay-menu-badge` span LOST (F1), AND the effective rendered order places Payments at position 0, then `separator-woocommerce`, then `woocommerce` (F4 — WC re-clusters its separator). The two degradations are independent; neither worsens the other; both persist across reload. | **degraded** — sum of F1 (badge loss) + F4 (separator re-cluster); no new failure mode from combining. Timing: badge loss is Maestro-overwrite-after-Woo; separator slot is Woo's render-time `menu_order`. |
| S3 | **Re-icon a feature-gated item + reorder across the custom separator** — re-icon Marketing AND move it ahead of `woocommerce` (crossing `separator-woocommerce`) | `{"items":{"woocommerce-marketing":{"icon":"dashicons-money-alt"}},"top_order":["woocommerce-marketing","woocommerce"]}` | Marketing's icon swaps to `dashicons-money-alt` (top-level re-icon, **safe**, persists) AND the effective order renders `woocommerce-marketing` at position 0, then `separator-woocommerce`, then `woocommerce` — i.e. Maestro successfully moves Marketing across/ahead of the WooCommerce cluster, and WC's filter only re-anchors its own separator to `woocommerce` (does not drag Marketing back). Persists across reload. | **degraded** (overall) — the re-icon is safe; the reorder honors the requested item slot but inherits the F4 separator caveat. No broken behavior crossing the separator. Timing: Woo render-time `menu_order` separator anchoring. |

**Promote-to-schema worthiness:** **Promoted (Plan 14-03).** The interaction-scenarios section
proved genuinely revealing (S1's non-cascading parent-hide is a finding the single-op matrix could
not surface), and the pattern is plugin-agnostic — every Phase 15 plugin with a parent/child menu or
a custom separator benefits from the same three probes. Accordingly, an optional **"## Interaction
Scenarios"** section with these three canonical probes (hide-parent-with-visible-children,
rename+reorder, re-icon+reorder-across-separator) was promoted into `SCHEMA.md` so SURV-02..06
inherit it (see the SCHEMA.md "Schema changes (Phase 14)" changelog, change #4).

## Part 3 — Classified-Fix List

Every surfaced issue from the matrix gets one classified fix using exactly one R1 category. These entries feed DELV-02's prioritized backlog in Phase 16. **No orphans:** every degraded cell and every degraded interaction-scenario finding in Part 2 maps to exactly one row below.

Allowed R1 fix categories:

1. **slug-resolution tweak**
2. **later `admin_menu` re-hook** (later admin_menu re-hook)
3. **special-casing**
4. **documented limitation**

> **Coverage note.** Part 2 surfaced **no `broken` cells** across 37 matrix rows + 3 interaction scenarios. Every classified fix below therefore addresses a `degraded` (cosmetic/recoverable) pattern. The recurring patterns are indexed by their cross-cutting finding ID (F1–F5) or the slug-encoding caveat, so each fix traces directly to the matrix cells that exhibit it.

| # | Issue summary | Affected operation(s) | Affected items / source | Chosen classification | One-line rationale |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| I1 | **Badge-in-title span lost on rename (F1)** — renaming a title that carries a baked-in count-badge `<span>` overwrites `$menu/$submenu[..][0]` wholesale, dropping the badge | Rename | Payments (`wcpay-menu-badge`), Extensions (`update-plugins count`), Home in fresh state (`remaining-tasks-badge`), Orders (processing-count when >0) — matrix rows + F1 | **documented limitation** | Loss is purely cosmetic, recoverable on reset, and intrinsic to WooCommerce baking dynamic counts into the static title string; preserving every plugin's badge HTML generically is not an R1-scoped slug/timing fix. (Could be revisited as **special-casing** in a later milestone if badge preservation is prioritized — noted for DELV-02.) |
| I2 | **`separator-woocommerce` re-clustering on top-level reorder (F4)** — WC's own `menu_order` filter (prio 10, runs after Maestro at the same prio) re-anchors its separator immediately before the `woocommerce` item, overriding Maestro's separator placement | Reorder | `separator-woocommerce`, and any top-level item placed adjacent to the WooCommerce cluster — matrix rows + F4 | **documented limitation** | The requested *item* order is honored and persists; only the separator's slot is overridden, which is cosmetic and never affects access. WC claims `custom_menu_order` unconditionally, so this is inherent co-existence behavior, not a Maestro defect. (A **later `admin_menu` re-hook** would not help — the collision is at render-time `menu_order`, not `admin_menu`; re-asserting separator order would mean fighting WC's filter every load, out of R1 scope.) |
| I3 | **Entity-encoded Products-taxonomy slugs** — taxonomy submenus render with `&amp;`-encoded slugs (e.g. `edit-tags.php?taxonomy=product_brand&amp;post_type=product`); a stored override only lands if its slug string matches the rendered (entity-encoded) form | Rename, Reorder, Hide | Products → Brands / Categories / Tags — matrix rows + slug-encoding caveat | **slug-resolution tweak** | The override is correct but the match key diverges between the captured form and the rendered form; normalizing slug comparison (decode/encode-insensitive matching) is exactly a slug-resolution tweak in how Maestro resolves the target row. |
| I7 | **Shared-slug collision: Products top-level and its All Products submenu both use `edit.php?post_type=product`** — Maestro matches overrides by exact slug, so a rename/hide keyed on that slug lands on BOTH the top-level parent and the All Products child simultaneously (observed: both titles became "Catalog") | Rename, Hide | Products top-level + Products → All Products — matrix rows | **documented limitation** | This is WordPress's own post-type menu shape (the top-level item and its first submenu legitimately share a slug), not a Maestro defect; targeting one without the other would require a level-aware match key (top-level vs. submenu disambiguation). Behavior is correct and never breaks access — the override simply applies to both rows. Flagged for DELV-02 as a possible **slug-resolution tweak** (level-qualified match) if per-row targeting is later prioritized. |
| I4 | **Submenu re-icon is a silent no-op (F2)** — replay only writes the icon to the top-level `$menu[pos][6]`; submenu rows have no icon index, so `{"icon":...}` on a submenu slug changes nothing | Re-icon | Every submenu row (31 rows) — matrix N/A cells + F2 | **documented limitation** | The operation does not exist for submenus in WordPress's menu model (submenu rows carry no icon slot); it never breaks anything. Correct and safe by design — accepted as-is. |
| I5 | **Cosmetic per-role Hide; page still loads by direct URL (F3)** — Maestro's Hide is a per-role `unset()` that never strips a capability, so a hidden page still LOADS (200) by direct URL for any role that holds the page cap | Hide | All hideable items, per-role (admin / editor / shop_manager) — matrix Hide cells + F3 | **documented limitation** | This is the intended, safe Maestro semantic: Hide is a sidebar-visibility convenience, not an access-control mechanism (R1's core value is "zero risk to access"). Any 403 a user hits is WordPress's own cap gate, not Maestro. Documented so it is never mistaken for a security boundary. |
| I6 | **Parent-hide does not cascade to children (Interaction S1)** — hiding the top-level `woocommerce` item from a role leaves all 8 child `$submenu` rows populated; the subtree is cosmetically orphaned (parent anchor gone) but every child page still LOADS by URL | Hide (parent + children interaction) | `woocommerce` parent + its submenu subtree — Interaction Scenario S1 | **documented limitation** | Non-cascading is the safe default — children remain reachable, so hiding a parent never silently severs access. Cascading-on-parent-hide would be a behavior change with access implications, out of R1's research-only scope. Flagged for DELV-02 as a potential **special-casing** UX option (optional subtree-hide) in a later milestone. |

**Interaction scenarios S2 (rename+reorder) and S3 (re-icon+reorder-across-separator)** surfaced no new failure mode: each is the clean sum of independent degradations already classified above (S2 = I1 + I2; S3 = safe re-icon + I2). They are therefore covered by I1/I2 and need no separate fix row.

## Success-Criterion Traceability

This section maps survey sections to the four Phase 14 success criteria and the SURV-01 requirement, so the gsd-verifier and Phase 16 (DELV-01/DELV-02) confirm coverage without inference. (The Method header above also carries a per-plan traceability table; this is the consolidated end-of-survey view.)

| Phase 14 success criterion | Where addressed in this survey | Status |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 1. Survey covers HOW WooCommerce registers/manipulates the menu (all six manipulation dimensions) | Part 1 — Manipulation-Dimensions Checklist (all six checked with source + runtime evidence) + the Method / baseline header + `SURV-01-assets/baseline-*.txt` (Plan 14-01) | ✅ Met |
| 2. Every Maestro op classified safe/degraded/broken per affected item, with observable evidence + persistence + timing cause | Part 2 — Classification Matrix (37 rows × rename/reorder/hide/re-icon), cross-cutting findings F1–F5 + F4a, per-role Hide (with rendered post-cap-filter check), top-level reorder from effective render order, + Interaction Scenarios S1–S3 (Plan 14-02) | ✅ Met |
| 3. Every surfaced issue gets exactly one classified R1 fix | Part 3 — Classified-Fix List above (I1–I6; every degraded matrix cell + interaction finding mapped to one of the four categories, no orphans) (Plan 14-03) | ✅ Met |
| 4. Schema gaps resolved; SCHEMA.md committed in final form before Phase 15 | `SCHEMA.md` "## Schema changes (Phase 14)" changelog + this SURV-01 copy reconciled to the final schema shape (Plan 14-03) | ✅ Met |
| Requirement **SURV-01** (WooCommerce surveyed and documented) | This entire file — HOW (Part 1) + what breaks (Part 2) + classified fixes (Part 3) | ✅ Met |

## Survey Completion Check

- [x] All six manipulation dimensions above are checked or left unchecked with `Notes:` evidence. — All six checked in Part 1, each with source citation + runtime-baseline evidence.
- [x] Every affected top-level menu item has a matrix row. — WooCommerce, separator-woocommerce, Payments, Analytics, Marketing, and Products (`edit.php?post_type=product`) (6 top-level rows).
- [x] Every affected submenu has a matrix row. — All 9 `woocommerce` submenus, 2 Marketing, 11 Analytics, and 10 Products submenus (All Products + Add New defaults, plus Brands/Categories/Tags/Attributes/Reviews/Import/Export injected) (31 submenu rows; 37 rows total with top-level).
- [x] Every Rename cell is classified `safe`, `degraded`, or `broken` with evidence. — Every row's Rename cell classified with observable evidence + persistence.
- [x] Every Reorder cell is classified `safe`, `degraded`, or `broken` with evidence. — Top-level from effective render order (reorder-probe.php); submenu via `sub_order`; each cell classified.
- [x] Every Hide cell is classified `safe`, `degraded`, or `broken` with evidence. — Per-role (admin / editor / shop_manager) with cosmetic-vs-access (loads-200 vs WP cap-403) noted per F3, using the two-gate model: each sub-cell = Maestro's cosmetic `unset()` on replay state + WP's independent render-time cap gate (with "moot no-op" where WP already gates the role away). Per-role render outcomes measured via a separate post-cap-filter check (Method header, "Per-role observation"), not read off the raw replay-state dump.
- [x] Every Re-icon cell is classified `safe`, `degraded`, or `broken` with evidence. — Top-level safe; submenu N/A→degraded (F2), rationale stated.
- [x] Every issue has exactly one classified fix: slug-resolution tweak, later `admin_menu` re-hook (later admin_menu re-hook), special-casing, or documented limitation. — Part 3 I1–I6: each surfaced degraded pattern + interaction finding mapped to exactly one category; no orphans; S2/S3 covered by I1/I2.
- [x] The filled survey copy remains under `.planning/compat/SURV-NN-<plugin>.md`; this `SCHEMA.md` template remains pristine. — This copy is `.planning/compat/SURV-01-woocommerce.md`. NOTE: `SCHEMA.md` is intentionally refined in Plan 14-03 (the one allowed edit point) and now carries a "Schema changes (Phase 14)" changelog; it is no longer pristine **by design** per 14-CONTEXT's batched-refinement workflow.
