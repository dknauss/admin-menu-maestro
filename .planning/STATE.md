# Project State

## Project Reference

See: .planning/PROJECT.md (updated 2026-06-14)

**Core value:** Editing the admin menu happens directly on the menu, with zero ceremony and zero risk to access.
**Current focus:** v1.1 "Polish & Accessibility" — milestone scoped and roadmapped (phases 6–8); ready to plan Phase 6

## Current Position

Milestone: v1.1 Polish & Accessibility (phases 6–8; v1.0 phases 1–5 complete & archived)
Phase: Not started (roadmap complete; Phase 6 next to plan)
Plan: —
Status: v1.0 milestone archived → `.planning/milestones/v1.0-*` + `.planning/MILESTONES.md` + `.planning/RETROSPECTIVE.md`. v1.1 scoped + roadmapped — 6 requirements promoted from the v2 backlog (ICON-01, A11Y-06, UX-01, UX-02, DOC-01; REL-06 already done). v1.0.0 remains submitted to WordPress.org, awaiting review (external; on approval → SVN commit to trunk, tag 1.0.0, upload .wordpress-org/ to SVN assets/).

## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- Project init: Plugin was brownfield and green at intake; current release checks are unit 44/44, integration 29/29, E2E 9/9, phpcs clean, and Plugin Check reports no errors on the extracted build zip.
- Roadmap: TEST + PERF combined into Phase 3 (Verification) to keep coarse granularity (5 phases); REL-05 (submit) is its own capstone phase.
- Security scan: Codex Security scan `317283f_20260614T024544Z` found one low-severity editor DOM XSS hardening issue (`innerHTML` for localized labels) and fixed it by switching the shared helper to `textContent`; no open findings remain in the final report.
- REST nonce verification: Integration tests now simulate the WordPress REST cookie-auth nonce gate and verify missing/invalid nonces reject GET/POST/DELETE `/config` requests without mutating stored config.
- Accessibility audit: Static/code audit closed A11Y-01 through A11Y-05. The editor now supports keyboard item selection with `Enter`/`Space`, focus restoration for popovers, save success/failure announcements through `wp.a11y.speak()`, and public documentation of the v1 keyboard-reordering limitation.
- Verification: Phase 3 is closed. Unit tests remain 44/44. Integration tests now run 29 tests / 81 assertions, adding reset-all idempotence/partial-config coverage plus performance contracts for non-autoloaded storage, edit-mode-only assets, localized payload budget, localized editor label coverage, and the bundled language path header. Playwright E2E now runs 9/9, including reset-this-item and per-role visibility.
- Testing tools: Node.js v24.16.0, npm/npx 11.13.0, Colima v0.10.3, Lima v2.1.2, Docker CLI 29.5.3, Docker Compose v5.1.4, and Playwright Chromium were installed under user-local locations. Colima is running with the `colima` Docker context.
- Release assets: `.wordpress-org/` contains `icon.svg`, `icon-128x128.png`, `icon-256x256.png`, `banner-772x250.png`, `banner-1544x500.png`, and `screenshot-1.png` through `screenshot-4.png`. PNG dimensions were verified with `file`. GitHub `README.md` now displays the banner, screenshots, and quick-start docs; wp.org `readme.txt` includes matching screenshot captions and usage docs; `docs/user-guide.md` contains the longer walkthrough. REL-01 through REL-04 are complete and Phase 4 is closed.
- Localization: The plugin is translation-ready with the `maestro-menu-editor` text domain and `Domain Path: /languages`. PHP strings use WordPress translation helpers, and editor UI labels are passed to JavaScript through the localized `maestroData.i18n` payload. The repo ships a POT template plus starter catalogs for `es_ES`, `de_DE`, `ja`, `fr_FR`, `pt_BR`, and `it_IT`; WordPress.org language packs can still override and extend them, and native-speaker/Polyglots review is welcome.
- Docs: Living docs are README.md, readme.txt, docs/user-guide.md, SPEC.md, TESTING.md, and `.planning/*`. `docs/archive/FIXES.md` is historical only and no longer treated as the active punchlist.
- Submit prep: `bin/build.sh` produces `build/maestro-menu-editor.zip`; WPCS (`composer lint`) passed 7/7; official Plugin Check 2.0.0 reported no errors on the extracted build zip; npm audit reports 0 vulnerabilities after removing unused `@wordpress/scripts`; local unit 44/44, integration 29/29, and E2E 9/9 pass. `pretest:e2e` activates the plugin by slug (`maestro-menu-editor/maestro-menu-editor.php`).
- [Phase 06-accessibility-interaction]: TDD seam for Phase 6 JS: node:test (built-in, zero new deps) + pure helpers in assets/maestro-logic.js; dual-export guard for node:test + browser; node --test auto-discovery used (Node 24.14 lacks directory-form CLI support)
- [Phase 06-accessibility-interaction]: buildConfig() diff delegated to window.maestroLogic.diffItem() — one source of truth for modified-state detection; payload shape unchanged
- [Phase 06-accessibility-interaction]: speak() optional politeness arg: omitted = polite (success moves); 'assertive' for boundary clamps — existing callers unchanged
- [Phase 06-accessibility-interaction]: e2e reset-all cleanup: waitForNavigation() before expect.poll() prevents 51265eval racing doResetAll's window.location.reload()
- [Phase 06-accessibility-interaction]: Non-color modified indicator: amber #dba617 bullet glyph (5.5:1 on #1d2327) + clip-path screen-reader-text — color supplementary, shape+text are the signal (WCAG 1.4.1 / 1.4.11)
- [Phase 06-accessibility-interaction]: refreshModifiedIndicator driven by maestroLogic.diffItem (unit-tested) wired to commitRename, icon choose, visibility change, resetSelected, and init sweep — single source of truth

### Pending Todos

- Await WordPress.org review verdict. On approval: SVN commit to `trunk`, tag `1.0.0`, upload `.wordpress-org/` to the SVN `assets/` dir.

(Done: git tag `v1.0.0` + GitHub Release "Admin Menu Maestro 1.0.0" published, anchored at the finalize-1.0.0 commit `c5f31b8`.)

### Blockers/Concerns

- Resolved: the earlier 8 Dependabot alerts are closed (2026-06-14 dependency cleanup).
- Resolved (2026-06-15): a new moderate alert (#13, `js-yaml` GHSA-h67p-54hq-rp68, quadratic merge-key DoS) surfaced after the GHSA was published. Triaged as **dev-only** — `js-yaml@3.14.2` is pulled solely by `@wordpress/env` (local test harness) and is never shipped (`bin/build.sh` packages PHP + assets, not `node_modules`). `npm audit` reports `fixAvailable:false` (wp-env requires js-yaml 3.x; forcing 4.x removes `safeLoad` and breaks wp-env). `npm prune` cleared 1342 orphaned/extraneous packages from `node_modules` but did not change the lockfile or the alert. Alert **dismissed as `tolerable_risk`**. No runtime/user exposure.
