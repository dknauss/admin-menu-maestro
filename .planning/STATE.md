# Project State

## Project Reference

See: .planning/PROJECT.md (updated 2026-06-14)

**Core value:** Editing the admin menu happens directly on the menu, with zero ceremony and zero risk to access.
**Current focus:** v1.0.0 submitted to WordPress.org — awaiting review verdict (all 5 phases complete)

## Current Position

Phase: 5 of 5 (Submit) — complete
Plan: —
Status: All milestone work done. Plugin submitted to WordPress.org; in the review queue. Approval and SVN access are pending (external). On approval: SVN commit to trunk, tag 1.0.0, upload .wordpress-org/ to the SVN assets/ dir.
Last activity: 2026-06-14 — Submitted to WordPress.org; reconciled planning docs to the submitted state (phases 1–5 complete); confirmed CI green, Dependabot 0 open alerts, Playground demo link live; repointed git remote to dknauss/Maestro

Progress: [██████████] 100%

## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- Project init: Plugin was brownfield and green at intake; current release checks are unit 44/44, integration 29/29, E2E 9/9, phpcs clean, and Plugin Check reports no errors on the extracted build zip.
- Roadmap: TEST + PERF combined into Phase 3 (Verification) to keep coarse granularity (5 phases); REL-05 (submit) is its own capstone phase.
- Security scan: Codex Security scan `317283f_20260614T024544Z` found one low-severity editor DOM XSS hardening issue (`innerHTML` for localized labels) and fixed it by switching the shared helper to `textContent`; no open findings remain in the final report.
- REST nonce verification: Integration tests now simulate the WordPress REST cookie-auth nonce gate and verify missing/invalid nonces reject GET/POST/DELETE `/config` requests without mutating stored config.
- Accessibility audit: Static/code audit closed A11Y-01 through A11Y-05. The editor now supports keyboard item selection with `Enter`/`Space`, focus restoration for popovers, save success/failure announcements through `wp.a11y.speak()`, and public documentation of the v1 keyboard-reordering limitation.
- Verification: Phase 3 is closed. Unit tests remain 44/44. Integration tests now run 29 tests / 81 assertions, adding reset-all idempotence/partial-config coverage plus performance contracts for non-autoloaded storage, edit-mode-only assets, localized payload budget, localized editor label coverage, and the bundled language path header. Playwright E2E now runs 9/9, including reset-this-item and per-role visibility.
- Testing tools: Node.js v24.16.0, npm/npx 11.13.0, Colima v0.10.3, Lima v2.1.2, Docker CLI 29.5.3, Docker Compose v5.1.4, and Playwright Chromium were installed under user-local locations. Colima is running with the `colima` Docker context.
- Release assets: `.wordpress-org/` contains `icon.svg`, `icon-128x128.png`, `icon-256x256.png`, `banner-772x250.png`, `banner-1544x500.png`, and `screenshot-1.png` through `screenshot-4.png`. PNG dimensions were verified with `file`. GitHub `README.md` now displays the banner, screenshots, and quick-start docs; wp.org `readme.txt` includes matching screenshot captions and usage docs; `docs/user-guide.md` contains the longer walkthrough. REL-01 through REL-04 are complete and Phase 4 is closed.
- Localization: The plugin is translation-ready with the `admin-menu-maestro` text domain and `Domain Path: /languages`. PHP strings use WordPress translation helpers, and editor UI labels are passed to JavaScript through the localized `ammData.i18n` payload. The repo ships a POT template plus starter catalogs for `es_ES`, `de_DE`, `ja`, `fr_FR`, `pt_BR`, and `it_IT`; WordPress.org language packs can still override and extend them, and native-speaker/Polyglots review is welcome.
- Docs: Living docs are README.md, readme.txt, docs/user-guide.md, SPEC.md, TESTING.md, and `.planning/*`. `docs/archive/FIXES.md` is historical only and no longer treated as the active punchlist.
- Submit prep: `bin/build.sh` produced `build/admin-menu-maestro.zip`; WPCS (`composer lint`) passed 7/7; official Plugin Check 2.0.0 reported no errors on the extracted build zip; npm audit reports 0 vulnerabilities after removing unused `@wordpress/scripts`; local unit 44/44, integration 29/29, and E2E 9/9 pass. `pretest:e2e` now activates the plugin by slug (`admin-menu-maestro`) to avoid a false active state from the file-path form.

### Pending Todos

- Await WordPress.org review verdict. On approval: SVN commit to `trunk`, tag `1.0.0`, upload `.wordpress-org/` to the SVN `assets/` dir.
- Optional: tag `v1.0.0` in git to mark the submitted release.

### Blockers/Concerns

- Resolved: GitHub Dependabot now reports **0 open alerts** (verified 2026-06-14, post dependency cleanup). The earlier 8 are closed.
