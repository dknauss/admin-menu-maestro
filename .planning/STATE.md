## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- [Phase 07]: Non-color status via ::before glyphs replaced with dashicons; idle dot de-emphasised (BUG-04/BUG-05)
- [Phase 07]: First-run cue as fixed bar above toolbar, localStorage-gated — same gate pattern applies to UX-03
- [Phase 07]: BUG-03 toolbar wrap/stack at narrow widths landed — UX-07 continues from this base for denser mobile sizing
- [Phase 09]: Single phase for all three v1.2 requirements — UX-03/UX-04/UX-07 are independent CSS/JS changes to one surface (assets/maestro.js, assets/maestro.css, includes/class-assets.php); no split needed at coarse granularity
- [Phase 09]: Behavioral JS (first-run cue gate, indicator state transitions) is test-eligible via node:test; CSS-only sizing is TDD-exempt per project CLAUDE.md

### Pending Todos

- **REL-07/REL-08 (deferred)** — refreshed banner + gallery-optimized screenshots; image work; no blocking dependency on v1.2
- **V2-15 (backlog)** — role cloning for per-user menu hiding: feasibility note before any build

### Blockers/Concerns

None.
