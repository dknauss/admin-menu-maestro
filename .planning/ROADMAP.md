## Phase Details (v1.1)

### Phase 6: Accessibility & Interaction
**Goal**: The editor is fully keyboard-operable for reordering, and every changed item visibly signals its modified state with a discoverable per-item reset
**Depends on**: Phase 5
**Requirements**: A11Y-06, UX-01
**Success Criteria** (what must be TRUE):
  1. Menu items can be moved up and down using keyboard controls (e.g. modifier+arrow or ARIA grab/drop semantics) without a mouse — confirmed by keyboard-only walkthrough
  2. The keyboard reordering implementation holds at 0 regressions: unit 44/44, integration 29/29, e2e 9/9 green, Plugin Check 0 errors
  3. Each menu item that differs from the default shows a visible "modified" indicator in edit mode — confirmed by before/after screenshot
  4. Per-item reset is a discoverable affordance (visible or keyboard-reachable without prior knowledge), not buried or hidden
**Plans**: 3 plans
  - [x] 06-01-PLAN.md — TDD seam (node:test) + pure reorderMove/diffItem/resetItem helpers [A11Y-06, UX-01]
  - [x] 06-02-PLAN.md — Alt+Arrow keyboard reorder + wp.a11y.speak() move announcements + e2e [A11Y-06]
  - [x] 06-03-PLAN.md — modified indicator (non-color, AA) + discoverable per-item reset + docs + e2e [UX-01]

### Phase 7: Visual Polish & Icons
**Goal**: The bundled icon picker reads at a weight that mixes naturally with WordPress's solid dashicons, and the overall edit-mode UI is visually polished and responsive
**Depends on**: Phase 6
**Requirements**: ICON-01, UX-02, BUG-01, BUG-02, BUG-03, BUG-04, BUG-05
**Reopened 2026-06-16**: UX-02 sign-off is blocked by five edit-mode defects triaged from the wp-sudo thread (see REQUIREMENTS.md → Defects). BUG-01 (double "Saved" check) and BUG-03 (responsive button overlap) directly contradict success criterion 2; BUG-05 swaps the emoji status glyphs for dashicons.
**Success Criteria** (what must be TRUE):
  1. The bundled icon set uses solid/filled variants (Bootstrap `*-fill` or Heroicons Mini fallback) that sit visually alongside dashicons without appearing noticeably lighter — confirmed by side-by-side screenshot of the two tabs
  2. Edit-mode control hierarchy, spacing, and status clarity are improved with no text-overlap or control-resize regressions — confirmed by before/after screenshots and keyboard/mouse walkthrough notes
  3. Icon picker grid is visually scannable at the dashicons grid size (20px glyphs)
  4. UI changes hold at 0 regressions: unit 44/44, integration 29/29, e2e 9/9 green, Plugin Check 0 errors
**Plans**: 4 plans
  - [x] 07-01-PLAN.md — TDD fill-resolution policy + regenerate solid icon bundle [ICON-01]
  - [x] 07-02-PLAN.md — edit-mode polish: toolbar hierarchy, non-color status, ~20px grid, first-run cue [UX-02]
  - [x] 07-03-PLAN.md — e2e regression + side-by-side/before-after screenshots + walkthrough notes [UX-02, ICON-01]
  - [x] 07-04-PLAN.md — edit-mode defect fixes: BUG-01 (drop ✓ from i18n string), BUG-02 (move breadcrumb right of input so it can't shift + relabel "Title"), BUG-03 (toolbar wrap/stack at narrow widths), BUG-04+BUG-05 (replace emoji status glyphs ○⏳✓⚠ with dashicons; idle dot de-emphasised) + regression screenshots at narrow viewport [BUG-01, BUG-02, BUG-03, BUG-04, BUG-05, UX-02]

### Phase 8: Docs & Brand Assets
**Goal**: In-prose file references are live markdown links; the wp.org/GitHub banner is rebuilt from an editable SVG master with a repeatable pipeline; and the live directory listing is polished for the next release (readme copy, Playground demo link, refreshed banner + screenshots)
**Depends on**: Phase 7
**Requirements**: DOC-01, REL-06, DOC-02, DOC-03, REL-07, REL-08
**Listing polish added 2026-06-17** after the 1.0.0 page went live (see REQUIREMENTS.md → Docs & Assets). DOC-03 (Playground demo link) is a quick win and may ship as a standalone 1.0.1.
**Success Criteria** (what must be TRUE):
  1. Bare file-path references in README, readme.txt, user guide, SPEC, TESTING, and planning docs are converted to markdown links — confirmed by a grep for common bare-path patterns returning no results
  2. An editable vector source for the banner exists under `.wordpress-org/source/` with the decorative leader line before "ADMIN MENU" removed — **reconciled 2026-06-17:** the editable source is the in-code SVG master generated by `build_final.py` (the `banner_svg()`/`icon_svg()` builders + the `P = dict(...)` palette), not a standalone `.svg` file; intent met (editable source + leader line removed)
  3. `npm run assets:banners` regenerates `banner-772x250.png` and `banner-1544x500.png` from that source (Inkscape render + Pillow LANCZOS downscale) without manual steps — **verified 2026-06-17:** `build_final.py` builds the SVG in code, rasterizes via Inkscape (`subprocess.run(["inkscape", …])`), then downscales 2× → 1× with Pillow; re-run from committed source reproduced both banners byte-identically at exact dimensions
  4. The public banner files under `.wordpress-org/` are replaced with the regenerated versions after visual review
**Plans**: 4 plans (executable scope); REL-07/REL-08 deferred
  - [x] 08-01-PLAN.md — TDD doc-link checker (RED: enumerate inline-code refs resolving to real repo files, not yet links) [DOC-01]
  - [x] 08-02-PLAN.md — convert flagged refs to markdown links + fix 3 stale paths (GREEN: 0 offenders) [DOC-01]
  - [x] 08-03-PLAN.md — verify `npm run assets:banners` regen + reconcile REL-06 mechanism wording (in-code SVG master + Inkscape + Pillow) [REL-06]
  - [x] 08-04-PLAN.md — zero-regression suite + flip DOC-01 Complete + mark Phase 8 done [DOC-01, REL-06]
  - [x] 08-05-PLAN.md — readme.txt copy rewrite (wp-readme-optimizer) + Playground "Try it first" demo link in readme + GitHub README [DOC-02, DOC-03] — **done in PR #28 (1.1.0 release)**
  - [ ] 08-06-PLAN.md — refreshed banner graphic (REL-06 pipeline) + gallery-optimized screenshots & captions; replace public assets after visual review [REL-07, REL-08] — **deferred (image work)**

<details>
<summary>✅ v1.2 Editor UX Polish (Phases 9–12) — SHIPPED 2026-06-22</summary>

Full phase details, success criteria, and outcomes are archived in
[milestones/v1.2-ROADMAP.md](milestones/v1.2-ROADMAP.md).

- [x] **Phase 9: Editor UX Polish** — Persistent "Edit Mode" indicator + first-run attention pulse, rename placeholder, auto-clearing "Saved" state, mobile-density controls (UX-03, UX-04, UX-07) — complete 2026-06-19
- [ ] **Phase 10: Third-Party Menu Compatibility Research** — WooCommerce-first compatibility research spike (V2-16); non-blocking, independent of the release cut; not shipped in v1.2 — carry forward
- [x] **Phase 11: Editor Entry & Reorder Fixes** — Mobile-reachable editor entry (≤782px admin-bar toggle); separator-safe ▲/▼ reorder buttons; modified-state badge on the changed row; 4-plan gap-closure wave after UAT (UX-08, BUG-06, BUG-07) — complete 2026-06-22
- [x] **Phase 11.1: P1 Review Hardening (INSERTED)** — `custom_menu_order` gated on stored `top_order`; `Config::sanitize()` payload bounded; three save-race e2e scenarios locked in (HARD-01/02/03) — complete 2026-06-20
- [x] **Phase 11.2: Editor Toolbar Redesign (INSERTED)** — Icon-only unified toolbar with semantic colour; retroactive record-only phase built via interactive design iteration (UX-10) — complete 2026-06-22
- [x] **Phase 12: Release Assets Refresh** — Balanced banner regenerated via REL-06 pipeline; 6 recaptured directory screenshots against the final v1.2 UI; readme captions synced (REL-07, REL-08) — complete 2026-06-22

## R1 — Third-Party Compatibility Research (Phases 13–16)

**Milestone Goal:** Document how Maestro's sparse-delta replay behaves against the six highest-impact admin-menu-manipulating plugins. Produce a committed reproducible wp-env harness, a consistent classification schema, per-plugin survey findings, a consolidated compatibility note, and a prioritized fix/limitation backlog. **No plugin code is committed. No release tag. No SVN deploy.**

**Track:** Non-versioned research. Deliverables are committed planning artifacts and a harness/test scaffolding only.

- [x] **Phase 13: Compatibility Harness + Classification Schema** — Committed multi-plugin wp-env config loading all six survey plugins at pinned versions, provisioned with admin and a lower-privilege user; plus the classification schema and safe/degraded/broken matrix template committed before any survey runs (completed 2026-06-26)
- [ ] **Phase 14: WooCommerce Survey** — Survey WooCommerce (locked first priority, heaviest manipulator) using the Phase 13 schema; stress-test and refine the schema against the hardest case
- [ ] **Phase 15: Remaining Survey Set** — Apply the proven schema to survey Jetpack, Yoast SEO / Rank Math, Elementor, WPForms, and LifterLMS
- [ ] **Phase 16: Synthesis** — Consolidated compatibility note presenting all six findings under one schema plus the safe/degraded/broken matrix; prioritized fix/limitation backlog with forward IDs seeded for a later versioned milestone

## Phase Details (R1)

### Phase 13: Compatibility Harness + Classification Schema
**Goal**: A committed, reproducible multi-plugin test environment and a consistent survey template exist before any survey work begins
**Depends on**: Nothing (first R1 phase)
**Requirements**: HARN-01, HARN-02, SCHM-01
**Success Criteria** (what must be TRUE):
  1. Running a single documented command (`cd tests/compat && npx wp-env start`, optionally wrapped as an `npm run compat:start` script) boots WordPress with all six survey plugins loaded at recorded pinned versions — confirmed by `wp plugin list` output in the running environment
  2. The harness provisions at least two users: an admin and at least one lower-privilege role user (e.g. Editor or Shop Manager) — confirmed by `wp user list` in the running environment
  3. A committed schema document defines all six manipulation dimensions (custom positions, conditional/late injection, re-registered menus, count badges in titles, custom separators, direct `$menu`/`$submenu` surgery) and a matrix template with columns for each Maestro operation (rename / reorder / hide / re-icon) and cells for safe/degraded/broken classification — confirmed by the committed file
  4. The schema template is committed before any SURV-xx file is authored, establishing a shared format all surveys will fill in
**Plans**: 2 plans
  - [x] 13-01-PLAN.md — compat wp-env harness: six pinned ZIP plugins + Maestro via ../.. + ports 8890/8891 + afterStart admin/Editor/Shop Manager provisioning + VERSIONS.md + compat:* scripts [HARN-01, HARN-02]
  - [x] 13-02-PLAN.md — classification-schema template at .planning/compat/SCHEMA.md (6 dimensions + rename/reorder/hide/re-icon × safe/degraded/broken matrix + classified-fix list) [SCHM-01]

### Phase 14: WooCommerce Survey
**Goal**: WooCommerce's menu-manipulation behavior is fully characterized using the Phase 13 schema, and the schema is refined against the hardest test case before the remaining five surveys run
**Depends on**: Phase 13
**Requirements**: SURV-01
**Success Criteria** (what must be TRUE):
  1. A committed survey document covers how WooCommerce registers and manipulates the admin menu (custom positions, conditional/late injection, re-registered menus, count badges baked into titles, custom separators, direct `$menu`/`$submenu` surgery)
  2. Every Maestro operation (rename / reorder / hide / re-icon) against WooCommerce menu items is classified as safe, degraded, or broken in the schema matrix, with observable evidence noted
  3. Every identified issue has a classified fix (slug-resolution tweak / later `admin_menu` re-hook / special-casing / documented limitation)
  4. Any gaps or ambiguities in the SCHM-01 template surfaced by WooCommerce's complexity are resolved and the schema committed in its final form before Phase 15 begins
**Plans**: TBD

### Phase 15: Remaining Survey Set
**Goal**: All five remaining survey plugins (Jetpack, Yoast SEO / Rank Math, Elementor, WPForms, LifterLMS) are surveyed using the proven schema from Phases 13–14
**Depends on**: Phase 14
**Requirements**: SURV-02, SURV-03, SURV-04, SURV-05, SURV-06
**Success Criteria** (what must be TRUE):
  1. Five committed survey documents exist — one each for Jetpack, Yoast SEO / Rank Math, Elementor, WPForms, and LifterLMS — each filling in the SCHM-01 template consistently
  2. Every Maestro operation against each plugin's menu items is classified as safe, degraded, or broken with observable evidence
  3. Every identified issue across all five surveys carries a classified fix (slug-resolution tweak / later `admin_menu` re-hook / special-casing / documented limitation)
  4. All five surveys use identical schema structure, making mechanical synthesis in Phase 16 possible
**Plans**: TBD

### Phase 16: Synthesis
**Goal**: All six per-plugin findings are merged into a single authoritative compatibility note and a ranked, classified fix/limitation backlog ready to seed a future versioned milestone
**Depends on**: Phase 14, Phase 15
**Requirements**: DELV-01, DELV-02
**Success Criteria** (what must be TRUE):
  1. A committed compatibility note presents all six per-plugin findings under the single SCHM-01 schema with a summary safe/degraded/broken matrix showing which Maestro operations are affected per plugin
  2. A committed prioritized backlog lists every surfaced issue ranked by severity/frequency, each classified as slug-resolution tweak / later `admin_menu` re-hook / special-casing / documented limitation
  3. Every backlog item carries a forward ID (e.g. COMPAT-01, COMPAT-02) ready to be referenced and scoped in a later versioned milestone without renaming
  4. The backlog contains no orphaned issues — every finding from SURV-01 through SURV-06 that requires action appears in the backlog or is explicitly marked as a documented limitation
**Plans**: TBD
