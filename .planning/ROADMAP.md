### 🚧 v1.1 Polish & Accessibility (In Progress)

**Milestone Goal:** Refine the shipped editor and finish the accessibility story. No new architecture — keyboard reordering, modified-state indicators, visual polish, heavier icons, documentation link hygiene, and a repeatable banner pipeline.

- [ ] **Phase 6: Accessibility & Interaction** — Keyboard-accessible reordering + modified indicator with per-item reset affordance
- [ ] **Phase 7: Visual Polish & Icons** — Heavier bundled icon set mixed with dashicons + edit-mode UI polish
- [ ] **Phase 8: Docs & Brand Assets** — Documentation link hygiene (test-first checker) + verify/reconcile the shipped banner pipeline

## Phase Details (v1.1)

### Phase 6: Accessibility & Interaction
**Goal**: The editor is fully keyboard-operable for reordering, and every changed item visibly signals its modified state with a discoverable per-item reset
**Depends on**: Phase 5
**Requirements**: A11Y-06, UX-01
**Success Criteria** (what must be TRUE):
  1. Menu items can be moved up and down using keyboard controls (e.g. modifier+arrow or ARIA grab/drop semantics) without a mouse — confirmed by keyboard-only walkthrough
  2. The keyboard reordering implementation holds at 0 regressions: unit 44/44, integration 29/29, e2e 9/9 green, Plugin Check 0 errors
  3. Each menu item that differs from the default shows a visible "modified" indicator in edit mode — confirmed by before/after screenshot
  4. Per-item reset is a discoverable affordance (visible or keyboard-reachable without prior knowledge), not buried or hidden
**Plans**: 3 plans
  - [ ] 06-01-PLAN.md — TDD seam (node:test) + pure reorderMove/diffItem/resetItem helpers [A11Y-06, UX-01]
  - [ ] 06-02-PLAN.md — Alt+Arrow keyboard reorder + wp.a11y.speak() move announcements + e2e [A11Y-06]
  - [ ] 06-03-PLAN.md — modified indicator (non-color, AA) + discoverable per-item reset + docs + e2e [UX-01]

### Phase 7: Visual Polish & Icons
**Goal**: The bundled icon picker reads at a weight that mixes naturally with WordPress's solid dashicons, and the overall edit-mode UI is visually polished and responsive
**Depends on**: Phase 6
**Requirements**: ICON-01, UX-02
**Success Criteria** (what must be TRUE):
  1. The bundled icon set uses solid/filled variants (Bootstrap `*-fill` or Heroicons Mini fallback) that sit visually alongside dashicons without appearing noticeably lighter — confirmed by side-by-side screenshot of the two tabs
  2. Edit-mode control hierarchy, spacing, and status clarity are improved with no text-overlap or control-resize regressions — confirmed by before/after screenshots and keyboard/mouse walkthrough notes
  3. Icon picker grid is visually scannable at the dashicons grid size (20px glyphs)
  4. UI changes hold at 0 regressions: unit 44/44, integration 29/29, e2e 9/9 green, Plugin Check 0 errors
**Plans**: 3 plans
  - [ ] 07-01-PLAN.md — TDD fill-resolution policy + regenerate solid icon bundle [ICON-01]
  - [ ] 07-02-PLAN.md — edit-mode polish: toolbar hierarchy, non-color status, ~20px grid, first-run cue [UX-02]
  - [ ] 07-03-PLAN.md — e2e regression + side-by-side/before-after screenshots + walkthrough notes [UX-02, ICON-01]

### Phase 8: Docs & Brand Assets
**Goal**: In-prose file references across all project docs are live markdown links, and the wp.org/GitHub banner is rebuilt from an editable SVG master with a repeatable generation pipeline
**Depends on**: Phase 7
**Requirements**: DOC-01, REL-06
**Success Criteria** (what must be TRUE):
  1. Bare file-path references in README, readme.txt, user guide, SPEC, TESTING, and planning docs are converted to markdown links — confirmed by a grep for common bare-path patterns returning no results
  2. An editable SVG master for the banner exists under `.wordpress-org/source/` with the decorative leader line before "ADMIN MENU" removed
  3. `npm run assets:banners` regenerates `banner-772x250.png` and `banner-1544x500.png` from the SVG master (Inkscape render + Pillow downscale/crop) without manual steps
  4. The public banner files under `.wordpress-org/` are replaced with the regenerated versions after visual review
**Plans**: 4 plans
  - [ ] 08-01-PLAN.md — TDD doc-link checker (RED: enumerate inline-code refs resolving to real repo files, not yet links) [DOC-01]
  - [ ] 08-02-PLAN.md — convert flagged refs to markdown links + fix 3 stale paths (GREEN: 0 offenders) [DOC-01]
  - [ ] 08-03-PLAN.md — verify `npm run assets:banners` regen + reconcile REL-06 mechanism wording (in-code SVG master + Inkscape + Pillow) [REL-06]
  - [ ] 08-04-PLAN.md — zero-regression suite + flip DOC-01 Complete + mark Phase 8 done [DOC-01, REL-06]
