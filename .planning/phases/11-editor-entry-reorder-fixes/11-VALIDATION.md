# Phase 11 — Validation Strategy

> Per-phase validation contract for feedback sampling during execution.

---

## Test Infrastructure

| Property | Value |
|----------|-------|
| **Framework** | PHPUnit (PHP unit + integration), Playwright (e2e), node:test (JS logic) |
| **Config file** | `phpunit.xml.dist` (unit), `phpunit-integration.xml.dist` (integration), `playwright.config.ts` (e2e) |
| **Quick run command** | `npm run test:js` (fast, no Docker) |
| **Full suite command** | `npm run test:js && npm run test:php && npm run test:e2e` |
| **Estimated runtime** | JS ~seconds; full suite (Docker e2e) several minutes — run sandbox-disabled |

**Baseline (Phase 11.1):** PHP unit 61/61 · JS 53/53 · integration 33/33 · e2e 28/28.

---

## Sampling Rate

- **After every task commit:** Run `npm run test:js` — catches JS logic regressions immediately (BUG-06/BUG-07 DOM glue, no Docker needed).
- **After every plan wave:** Run the full Playwright suite (`npm run test:e2e`, sandbox-disabled for Docker) plus `npm run test:php`.
- **Before `/gsd:verify-work`:** Full suite green — JS ≥53/53, PHP unit ≥61/61, integration ≥33/33, e2e ≥28/28 *plus the new Phase 11 tests*.
- **Max feedback latency:** ~seconds for the JS quick run; full e2e at wave boundaries.

## Per-Task Verification Map

> Task IDs are provisional — the planner finalizes them. Mapping is by requirement and test type.

| Requirement | Behavior | Test Type | Automated Command | File Exists | Status |
|-------------|----------|-----------|-------------------|-------------|--------|
| UX-08b | PHP label strings changed ("Edit Menu" / "Exit") | unit (PHP) | `phpunit tests/unit/AdminBarTest.php` | ⚠️ verify at plan time | ⬜ pending |
| UX-08b | i18n: no new JS keys → LocalizationTest unchanged | integration | `phpunit tests/integration/LocalizationTest.php` | ✅ | ⬜ pending |
| UX-08a | Toggle visible at ≤782px | e2e | `editor.spec.ts` — `setViewportSize({width:782})` + `toBeVisible()` | ❌ W0 | ⬜ pending |
| UX-08a | Icon-only (label text hidden) at ≤782px | e2e / screenshot | Playwright `boundingBox`/screenshot assertion at 782px | ❌ W0 (or manual) | ⬜ pending |
| BUG-06 | Single-node move leaves separators in place | e2e | new test: `li.wp-menu-separator` positions unchanged after Alt+Arrow | ❌ W0 | ⬜ pending |
| BUG-06 | Existing keyboard-reorder happy path still passes | e2e | `playwright test --grep "keyboard-only reorder"` | ✅ | ⬜ pending |
| BUG-07 | Badge renders next to label on item-with-submenu | e2e | `.maestro-modified-badge` inside `#menu-posts .wp-menu-name` | ❌ W0 | ⬜ pending |
| BUG-07 | Existing modified-indicator test still passes | e2e | `playwright test --grep "modified indicator"` | ✅ | ⬜ pending |

*Status: ⬜ pending · ✅ green · ❌ red · ⚠️ flaky*

## Wave 0 Requirements

- [ ] `tests/e2e/editor.spec.ts` — UX-08a viewport-visibility test (new `test()` block at ≤782px / ≤600px).
- [ ] `tests/e2e/editor.spec.ts` — BUG-06 separator-preservation test (new `test()` block; **first confirm** whether a separator fixture is needed — WP core registers separators at positions 4/9/25/59/99, so wp-env may already have them).
- [ ] `tests/e2e/editor.spec.ts` — BUG-07 badge-location assertion (badge inside `.wp-menu-name` for an item-with-submenu).
- [ ] `tests/unit/AdminBarTest.php` — confirm exists or create for the UX-08b PHP string change (LOW priority — existing `LocalizationTest` integration coverage may suffice; decide at plan time).

---

## Manual-Only Verifications

| Behavior | Requirement | Why Manual | Test Instructions |
|----------|-------------|------------|-------------------|
| Mobile tap-target reachability (visual/UX confirmation) | UX-08a | Visual confirmation beyond `toBeVisible()` — the automated e2e covers visibility; a human screenshot at ≤782px / ≤600px confirms it is tappable and not visually broken | Browser-capable session at execute time: load wp-admin at 782px and 600px viewports, confirm the Maestro toggle is visible, icon-only, and tappable; capture screenshot for the phase gate |

*Note: the UX-08a viewport-visibility assertion IS automatable in Playwright; the manual pass is a nice-to-have visual confirmation, not the primary gate.*

---

## Validation Sign-Off

- [ ] All tasks have `<automated>` verify or Wave 0 dependencies
- [ ] Sampling continuity: no 3 consecutive tasks without automated verify
- [ ] Wave 0 covers all MISSING references (3 new e2e tests + AdminBarTest confirmation)
- [ ] No watch-mode flags
- [ ] Feedback latency < ~5s for JS quick run
- [ ] `nyquist_compliant: true` set in frontmatter

**Approval:** pending
