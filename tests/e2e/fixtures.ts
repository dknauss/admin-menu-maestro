/**
 * Shared test fixtures for the in-place editor E2E suite.
 *
 * Test isolation: the plugin stores every menu override in ONE WordPress option
 * (MAESTRO_OPTION = 'maestro_config'), shared across the whole wp-env tests
 * instance. There is no per-test database. Without an explicit reset, state
 * mutated by one spec leaks into the next — e.g. the HARD-03 save-race specs
 * rename Posts to "ArticlesRaceC" and, when their cleanup DELETE loses the race,
 * leave Posts modified, which then fails unrelated specs that assert the natural
 * "Posts" label.
 *
 * The `maestroCleanConfig` auto-fixture deletes that option before every test so
 * each one starts from the natural WordPress menu, independent of prior leakage.
 * This is true isolation at the data layer — stronger than relying on each spec's
 * own end-of-test cleanup, which by definition cannot run when a race or crash
 * leaves state behind.

 * absent (the clean baseline) wp-cli exits non-zero, which we deliberately
 * swallow. Any real failure (Docker down, env not started) still surfaces as a
 * test failure downstream when the page can't reach a clean menu.
