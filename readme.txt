Rename, reorder, change icons, and hide WordPress admin menu items per user role — an inline admin menu editor you drive right on the menu itself.

== Description ==

**Maestro lets you orchestrate the appearance of the WordPress admin menu.** 

Instead of a separate settings screen, Maestro turns the admin menu into something you edit *in place* — right where it lives. Toggle **Edit Menu** from the admin bar, and the menu becomes editable. Click a menu item to rename it, hide it from selected user roles, or change its icon. Drag submenu items and whole menu groups to reorder them. 

**Try Maestro right here.** Launch a demo in [WordPress Playground](https://playground.wordpress.net/?blueprint-url=https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dknauss/Maestro/main/playground/blueprint-hosted.json) — it boots a throwaway site with the plugin active in edit mode, plus User Switching and test users (editor, author, contributor, subscriber; password `password`) so you can try per-role visibility by switching to another user's account.

= What you can do — as a site administrator =

Maestro's enhancements are only activated for logged-in users with an Administrator role. They can:

* **Rename** any top-level or submenu item — just click the label.
* **Reorder** items by dragging (top-level items among themselves, submenu items within their parent), or with the keyboard (`Alt`+`Arrow`).
* **Swap icons** on top-level items. The icon picker offers Dashicons and bundled Bootstrap Icons with search. It accepts any of WordPress's four native icon forms (dashicon, "none", base64 image data-URI, or an image URL).
* **Hide** items from chosen roles — including administrators. Custom roles registered by other plugins ([User Role Editor](https://wordpress.org/plugins/user-role-editor/), [Members](https://wordpress.org/plugins/members/), etc.) appear automatically.
* **Reset** a single item to its WordPress default, or reset everything at once.

Changes are **global** — one configuration applies to everyone. Your custom menu configuration is stored as a sparse delta (just the differences) layered over the menu WordPress builds on each load. Nothing is rebuilt or duplicated, so a reset simply removes the delta, and the original menu returns. 

= Important: visibility is cosmetic, not access control =

Hiding a menu item only declutters the menu. The underlying admin page still loads for anyone who knows or types its URL if they're authorized to see it. That's because a page's own registered **capability** is the true lock. Maestro operates on the menu (presentation), which is a different plane from authorization.

If you need to actually prevent *access*, pair Maestro with a capability manager like [PublishPress Capabilities](https://wordpress.org/plugins/capability-manager-enhanced/)**. It's menu-aware, and its Pro tier can block admin pages by URL.

The `maestro_capability` filter lets such a plugin hand editing rights to a custom capability instead of the default `manage_options`.

= Accessibility and localization =

The editor is keyboard-operable end to end — select with `Enter`/`Space`, reorder with `Alt`+`Arrow`, and every move and save is announced to screen
readers. Modified items carry a non-color indicator with screen-reader text, so their state is never indicated by color alone.

Maestro uses the `maestro-menu-editor` text domain and ships a translation template plus starter language packs for Spanish (`es_ES`), German (`de_DE`), Japanese (`ja`), French (`fr_FR`), Portuguese – Brazil (`pt_BR`), and Italian (`it_IT`). WordPress.org language packs override and extend these; native-speaker and WordPress Polyglots reviews are welcome.

== Installation ==

1. In your dashboard, go to **Plugins → Add New**, search for "Maestro: The Inline Admin Menu Editor", and click **Install Now**, then **Activate**.
2. Or upload the plugin zip via **Plugins → Add New → Upload Plugin**, then activate it.
3. Or, manually: unzip into `wp-content/plugins/maestro-menu-editor` and activate from **Plugins**.
4. After activating, click **Edit Menu** in the admin bar to start editing the admin menu in place.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Does hiding a menu item block access to that page or disable its features? =

No — and this is important. Hiding an item is **cosmetic**: it removes the link from the admin menu but does not stop anyone from reaching the page by typing or
bookmarking its URL. Real access is governed by each page's registered capability. To truly block all access to a page, use a capability manager such as
[User Role Editor](https://wordpress.org/plugins/user-role-editor/) or [PublishPress Capabilities](https://wordpress.org/plugins/capability-manager-enhanced/).

= Do my changes affect everyone, or just me? =

Everyone. Maestro stores one global configuration that applies to all users; it is not per-user. Per-role *visibility* lets you hide items from specific roles,
but the rename/reorder/icon changes themselves are global.

= Can I hide items from administrators, too? =

Yes. The hide by role feature includes the administrator role. However, you have to be an administrator to use Maestro's features, so if you hide a menu item from administrators, you are hiding it from yourself as well.

Remember that this is cosmetic, not a permission change, and you can reset any or all of the changes made in Maestro at any time.

= Does it work with custom roles from other plugins? =

Yes. Any role registered on the site — including custom roles from User Role Editor, Members, and similar plugins — appears automatically in the visibility
control.

= Is the editor keyboard accessible? =

Yes. You can select, rename, reorder (`Alt`+`Arrow`), open the icon and visibility controls, and reset items without a mouse. Saves and moves are announced to screen readers.

= What happens when I deactivate or reset the plugin? =

The admin menu returns to exactly what WordPress and your active plugins generate. Your customizations live in a single option as a sparse delta; **Reset All** deletes that option, and deactivating the plugin stops it from being applied.

= Can I move an item between a top-level position and a submenu? =

Not yet. Reparenting is deliberately deferred (see "Known limits" below). Top-level items reorder among top-level items, and submenu items reorder within
their current parent.

== Screenshots ==

1. The inline editor — select any admin-menu item to edit it in place using the icon-only unified toolbar and shared controls panel (rename, icon, visibility, reset).
2. The icon picker: searchable Dashicons and bundled Bootstrap Icons tabs for swapping a top-level admin menu icon.
3. Per-role visibility — open the visibility selector to hide an item from selected roles (cosmetic declutter, not access control).
4. A renamed item showing the transient "Saved" state — the indicator auto-clears to idle once the autosave settles.
5. Reordering a top-level menu group by dragging — a live sortable-helper shows the item in motion.
6. Reordering a submenu item using the ▲/▼ move controls — the OS-independent, keyboard-accessible reorder path.

== Architecture (for developers) ==

* `Config` — reads/writes/sanitizes a single option (`maestro_config`) holding only the deltas. Reset = delete the option; the natural menu returns automatically.
* `Replay` — on a late `admin_menu` pass, applies rename/icon/visibility to the `$menu`/`$submenu` globals and reorders submenus. Top-level order uses the core `custom_menu_order` + `menu_order` filters. Resilient to missing slugs (orphans are skipped) and new items (appended at the end).
* `Rest` — `maestro/v1/config` (GET/POST/DELETE), capability-gated, `X-WP-Nonce`.
* The editor JS is driven by a localized model (with DOM ids), not DOM scraping, and diffs against captured pristine defaults so the stored config stays sparse.
* Localized editor labels are passed from PHP to JavaScript in `maestroData.i18n`; the runtime zip includes the bundled POT template and starter catalogs.

== Known limits / deferred to v2 ==

* **Reparenting** (moving an item between a top-level position and a submenu) is not included. Top-level items reorder among top-level items, and submenu items reorder within their current parent. Reparenting needs hand-splicing of the globals plus `parent_file`/`submenu_file` highlighting fixes — a known minefield, parked deliberately.
* **Separators** are preserved in place but not yet add/move/delete-able; their generated slugs (`separator1`…) have no stable identity to key against.
* **Renaming** an item drops any core-appended count badge (e.g., pending comments) from that label, since the badge lives inside the title string.
* Submenu sort relies on items registering by the late `admin_menu` pass; a plugin that registers submenus on an unusually late hook may not be captured.

== Support This Plugin ==

If Maestro saves you time or brings you or your clients the joy of a tidy admin menu, you can support its ongoing maintenance through [GitHub Sponsors](https://github.com/sponsors/dknauss).

== Changelog ==

= 1.3.0 =
* Saved overrides now keep applying even when your site moves to a new host, when a plugin updates and changes a version number in its menu URL, when UTM tracking parameters drift on external-tool links, and when a taxonomy slug is stored with `&amp;` encoding instead of `&` (or vice versa) — no manual re-save needed.
* Edit-mode toolbar: the Exit and Reset All controls now use clearer, more consistent icons (Exit matches the admin-bar toggle).
* New: a first-run guided tour walks you through editing the menu — selecting an item, the rename/icon/visibility controls, reordering, autosave, and exit. A "?" button in the edit-mode toolbar replays it anytime. (It replaces the previous one-time menu highlight.)
* Fix: while editing, the menu's group separators no longer show as a stray dark band between sections (most noticeable above the Posts group); they collapse so items sit flush. The normal menu is unchanged.

= 1.2.0 =
* Redesigned edit-mode toolbar: every control is now a compact icon button in one consistent system, with colour signalling meaning — green for editing/saved, amber for unsaved changes, red for Reset All. Fully accessible: each control keeps its name for screen readers and shows a tooltip on hover.
* Mobile: the editor is reachable on phones now — the admin-bar "Edit Menu" toggle stays visible at small screen widths (it was hidden before), and the toolbar and controls are sized for touch.
* "Edit Mode" indicator: a persistent, glanceable cue that you're editing, plus a one-time first-run hint highlighting the menu.
* Rename: the field shows a placeholder label, and the transient "Saved" confirmation now clears itself after a moment so the toolbar stays quiet.
* Reorder: keyboard (Alt+Arrow) and the new ▲/▼ buttons leave menu separators in place; the per-item Reset button is disabled when there's nothing to undo.
* Robustness: Maestro engages WordPress's menu-order machinery only when you've actually reordered top-level items (otherwise it stays out of other plugins' way); the stored configuration is size-bounded; and concurrent save / reset / exit actions are race-safe.
* Fix: the "modified" indicator now sits on the changed row's label for items that have submenus.

= 1.1.1 =
* Editor: the selected item's name is now screen-reader-only — the visible breadcrumb duplicated the rename field and ate horizontal space, and the controls are self-explanatory. Screen-reader users still get the item/submenu context.
* Editor: shorter reset button labels — "Reset Item" and "Reset All".

= 1.1.0 =
* Keyboard reordering: select a menu item, then press `Alt+ArrowUp` / `Alt+ArrowDown` to move it. Each move is announced to screen readers (politely for success, assertively when already at the boundary). No mouse required.
* Modified indicator: changed items show a non-color glyph (•) with screen-reader text "(modified)" in edit mode. The indicator refreshes live on every rename, icon change, visibility change, and reset.
* Discoverable per-item reset: the **Reset this item** button in the controls panel is now keyboard-reachable (Tab + Enter/Space) and is visually emphasised whenever the selected item has unsaved overrides.
* Solid bundled icons: the Bootstrap Icons set now uses solid (`*-fill`) variants, so it mixes naturally with WordPress's dashicons in the picker.
* Edit-mode polish: clearer toolbar grouping, a more scannable icon grid, and a dismissible first-run hint.
* Native save status: the saving / saved / error states now use WordPress dashicons (a spinner, a check, a warning) instead of emoji glyphs that some platforms recoloured or dropped; the idle state shows no icon.
* Fixes: the saved status no longer renders a double check mark; the rename field no longer shifts as the title length changes; toolbar controls wrap instead of overlapping on narrow screens.
* Listing: rewritten description and FAQ, plus a "Try it first" link to a live WordPress Playground demo.

= 1.0.0 =
* Initial release: rename, reorder, per-role visibility, reset.
* Icons: accepts all four native WordPress forms (dashicon, none, base64 image data-URI, image URL); picker bundles dashicons + curated Bootstrap Icons with search, keyboard accessibility, and mobile-sized touch targets.
* Editor: click-to-select with a shared panel, debounced single-flight autosave, and folded-mode neutralization.

== Upgrade Notice ==

= 1.3.0 =
Reliability fix: your saved menu overrides keep applying after a site moves hosts, a plugin update changes a menu URL's version number, tracking parameters drift, or a slug's `&` is stored as `&amp;`. Adds a first-run guided tour for the editor (replay it with the toolbar "?"). No configuration changes required.

= 1.2.0 =
A redesigned, compact icon-only edit-mode toolbar; the editor is now reachable and touch-friendly on mobile; clearer "Edit Mode" and save states; separator-safe reordering; and internal hardening (scoped menu-order, bounded config, race-safe saves). No configuration changes required.

= 1.1.1 =
Minor editor UI tidy: the item-name label is now screen-reader-only, and the reset buttons are "Reset Item" / "Reset All". No configuration changes.

= 1.1.0 =
Keyboard-accessible reordering, a live "modified" indicator, solid bundled icons, native dashicon save-status, and responsive/edit-mode polish. No configuration changes required.
